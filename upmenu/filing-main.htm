                               (without par value)

        This  Information   Statement  is  being  furnished  by  PepsiCo,   Inc.
("PepsiCo") in connection with the distribution (the  "Distribution") to holders
of record of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock at the close of business on  September  19,
1997 of one share of common stock,  without par value (the "Common  Stock"),  of
TRICON  Global  Restaurants,  Inc.  ("TRICON" or the  "Company"),  for every ten
shares of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  held of record as of that  date.  Fractional
shares,  other than those held by participants in certain PepsiCo plans, will be
aggregated  into whole shares of TRICON Common Stock and sold on the open market
by the Distribution  Agent (as hereinafter  defined),  with the proceeds thereof
distributed  to  holders  who  would  otherwise  be  entitled  to  receive  such
fractional   shares.   See  "The   Distribution   -  Manner  of  Effecting   the
Distribution."

        The Company is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  PepsiCo.  As a result of
transactions  entered into in connection with the  Distribution,  as of 11:59:59
E.D.T.  on  October  6,  1997  (the  "Distribution   Date"),   TRICON  will  own
substantially  all of the businesses and assets of, and will be responsible  for
substantially all of the liabilities  associated with, PepsiCo's core restaurant
businesses.

        The  Distribution  will  be  effective  on  the  Distribution  Date.  No
consideration will be paid by PepsiCo's shareholders for shares of TRICON Common
Stock.  There is no current public market for the TRICON Common Stock,  although
it is expected  that a  "when issued"  trading  market will develop prior to the
Record  Date (as  hereinafter  defined).  Application  has been made to list the
TRICON Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").
    
           NO VOTE OF SHAREHOLDERS IS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
              DISTRIBUTION. NO PROXIES ARE BEING SOLICITED, AND YOU
                      ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND US A PROXY.

          THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE
           SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES
             COMMISSION NOR HAS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMIS-

                  THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS INFORMATION
                      STATEMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE
                         CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

                                                       conditions, including (i) a favorable ruling of the
                                                       Internal Revenue Service concerning the tax-free
                                                       nature of the Distribution, (ii) appropriate stock

                                                       various regulatory approvals, and (iv) approval by
                                                       PepsiCo's Board of Directors of the final terms of
                                                       the Distribution, including, without limitation,
                                                       the formal declaration of a dividend to PepsiCo's

                                                       the Distribution Date.

Reasons for the Distribution.....................      PepsiCo's management and Board of Directors have
                                                       concluded that the Distribution is in the best
                                                       interests of PepsiCo and its shareholders.  They
                                                       believe that the Distribution will (i) help to
                                                       alleviate competitive barriers to expanding
                                                       PepsiCo's fountain beverage business, (ii) allow
                                                       PepsiCo to focus its attention on its packaged
                                                       goods businesses, Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay, by
                                                       creating a separate company focused on PepsiCo's
                                                       core restaurant businesses, and (iii) permit
                                                       PepsiCo and TRICON to offer management incentives
                                                       more directly tied to the performance of their
                                                       respective businesses.  PepsiCo management also believes
                                                       that a separate restaurant company with strategies,
                                                       organizational goals and employee incentives more
                                                       narrowly focused will be best able to maximize its
                                                       financial performance.

Relationship between PepsiCo and
TRICON after the Distribution....................      After the Distribution, PepsiCo will have no
                                                       ownership interest in TRICON, and TRICON will be
                                                       an independent publicly-owned company.  However,

                                                       PepsiCo's employees.  PepsiCo and TRICON will enter
                                                       into certain agreements governing their
                                                       relationship subsequent to the Distribution.  
                                                       The agreements will provide for each party to make
                                                       certain services, records and personnel available
                                                       to the other.  They will also provide for

                                                       employee benefits and compensation and for
                                                       allocation of tax and certain other liabilities
                                                       between them for periods prior to and after the
                                                       Distribution.

                                                       discretion of the TRICON Board of Directors.
                                                       Dividend decisions will be based on a number of
                                                       factors including TRICON's operating results and

                                  INTRODUCTION

        TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc., a North Carolina corporation originally
organized in May 1997, is currently a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PepsiCo,  Inc.
The  management  and Board of Directors  of PepsiCo,  after  careful  review and
analysis,  have  concluded  that the  Distribution  is in the best  interests of
PepsiCo and its  shareholders.  They believe that the Distribution will (i) help
to alleviate  competitive  barriers to  expanding  PepsiCo's  fountain  beverage
business,  (ii)  allow  PepsiCo to focus its  attention  on its  packaged  goods
businesses,  Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay, by creating a separate company focused on
PepsiCo's  core  restaurant  businesses,  and (iii) permit PepsiCo and TRICON to
offer  management  incentives  more  directly tied to the  performance  of their
respective  businesses.   PepsiCo  management  also  believes  that  a  separate
restaurant company with strategies, organizational goals and employee incentives
more narrowly  focused will be best able to maximize its financial  performance.
To effect the Distribution,  PepsiCo will distribute all the outstanding  Common
Stock of TRICON to PepsiCo shareholders.

   
        Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ("Merrill Lynch") has served as financial advisor to
PepsiCo's  management in connection  with the  Distribution.  Merrill Lynch will
receive customary fees including expenses for its services as financial advisor.
PepsiCo has also agreed to indemnify  Merrill Lynch against certain  liabilities
and expenses in connection with its services as financial advisor.  In addition,
Merrill Lynch and its  affiliates  have acted,  and may in the future act, as an
underwriter  for, and have  participated as members of  underwriting  syndicates
with respect to, offerings of PepsiCo securities, and Merrill Lynch has effected
securities transactions for Pepsico and performed financial advisory services in
connection with certain acquisitions and dispositions by PepsiCo.  Merrill Lynch
has received fees from PepsiCo in the past for these services. Merrill Lynch may
in the future serve as an underwriter of TRICON securities.
    
          Upon  completion  of the  Distribution,  TRICON  will  be the  world's
largest quick service  restaurant ("QSR") company based on units, with more than
29,000 units in 95 countries and territories.  TRICON will use three of the most
recognized  restaurant  concepts,  Pizza  Hut,  Taco  Bell and KFC,  to sell its
products  through a system of both  Company-operated  and franchised  units.  In
1996,  TRICON's worldwide system sales exceeded $20 billion.  As one of only two
major global  players,  TRICON will have the advantage of  significant  scale in
activities ranging from purchasing to technology. In addition, the Company has a
solid track record of operating innovation,  strong cash generation capabilities
and clear areas of growth potential.

          TRICON's business, including background on the concepts, its operating
systems, management and its strategy for managing the refranchising of the store
portfolio,  is described below, followed by a discussion of the industry and how
TRICON fits into the industry today, and then by a discussion of the competitive
advantages available to TRICON.  See "Business of TRICON."

          From time to time,  in both  written and oral  statements,  TRICON and
PepsiCo may discuss  expectations  regarding TRICON's future performance.  These
"forward-looking  statements"  are  based on  currently  available  competitive,
financial  and  economic  data  and  TRICON's  operating  plans.  They  are also
inherently uncertain and

investors must recognize that actual results could turn out to be  significantly
different  than what was expected.  Among the many factors that can cause actual
results to differ are economic and  political  conditions  in the  countries and
territories  where TRICON  operates,  the impact of such  conditions on consumer
spending, pricing pressures resulting from competitive discounting,  new product
and concept development by other food industry competitors,  and fluctuations in
commodity prices.


                               BUSINESS OF TRICON

Concepts

          The  TRICON  organization  is  currently  made  up of  four  operating
divisions  organized  around its three core  concepts,  KFC,  Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell. KFC is based in  Louisville,  Kentucky;  Pizza Hut and TRICON  Restaurants
International  ("TRICON  International") are headquartered in Dallas, Texas; and
Taco Bell is based in Irvine, California.

          Each of TRICON's four operating divisions is engaged in the operation,
development,  franchising  and  licensing  of a system of both  traditional  and
non-traditional  QSR units.  Non-traditional  units  include  express  units and
kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in  non-traditional  locations
like  airports,  gas and  convenience  stores,  stadiums,  amusement  parks  and
colleges,  where a  full-scale  traditional  outlet  would not be  practical  or
efficient. In addition,  there are approximately 367 units housing more than one
concept ("2n1s"). Of these, approximately 354 units offer both the full KFC menu
and a limited menu of Taco Bell products,  and approximately 13 units offer both
the full KFC menu and a limited menu of Pizza Hut products.

        In each  concept,  consumers  can either  dine in or carry out food.  In
addition,  Taco Bell and KFC offer a drive-through  option in many stores. Pizza
Hut and, on a much more limited basis, KFC offer delivery service.

        Each concept has  proprietary  menu items and emphasizes the preparation
of food with high  quality  ingredients  as well as unique  recipes  and special
seasonings  to  provide  appealing,  tasty and  attractive  food at  competitive
prices.

        KFC

        KFC operates in 74 countries and territories  throughout the world under
the name  "Kentucky  Fried  Chicken"  and/or  "KFC." It was  founded  in Corbin,
Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders,  an early developer of the quick service
food business and a pioneer of the  restaurant  franchise  concept.  The Colonel
perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky  Fried Chicken in
1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952. By the time KFC was acquired by
PepsiCo in 1986, it had grown to  approximately  6,600 units in 55 countries and
territories.

        KFC  restaurants  offer  fried  chicken  products  and some  also  offer
non-fried  chicken-on-the-bone products, with the principal entree items sold in
pieces under the names  Original  Recipe,  Extra Tasty Crispy and Tender  Roast.
Other principal  entree items include Chunky Chicken Pot Pies,  Colonel's Crispy
Strips, and various chicken 

</p><p class="break"> 11

sandwiches.  KFC  restaurants  also  offer  a  variety  of side  items,  such as
biscuits, mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw and corn, as well as desserts and
non-alcoholic  beverages.  Their  decor  is  characterized  by the  image of the
Colonel and distinctive packaging includes the "Bucket" of chicken.
   
        In 1996,  KFC's  worldwide  system  sales of over $8 billion grew faster
than the industry  average even though the number of  restaurants  in its global
system did not materially increase. This growth was largely due to the impact of
new  products  as shown by the fact that same  store  sales in  Company-operated
stores in the U.S. increased 6%. In 1995, same store sales for  Company-operated
stores in the U.S. were also strong,  increasing 7%. For the first half of 1997,
KFC  same  store  sales  growth  for  Company-operated  units  in the  U.S.  was
consistently  positive  resulting  in a 4% growth  rate for the 24 week  period.
Average U.S. system-wide sales per traditional unit in 1996 were $775,000.
    

        Pizza Hut

        Pizza Hut operates in 84 countries and territories  throughout the world
under the name  "Pizza  Hut" and  features  a variety of pizzas  with  different
toppings  as  well as  pasta,  salads,  sandwiches  and  other  food  items  and
beverages. The distinctive decor features a bright red roof.

        The first Pizza Hut  restaurant  was opened in 1958 in Wichita,  Kansas,
and within a year, the first franchise unit was opened.  By 1977, when Pizza Hut
was acquired by PepsiCo,  its U.S.  restaurant  system had grown to nearly 3,200
units.   Today,  Pizza  Hut  is  the  largest  restaurant  chain  in  the  world
specializing  in the sale of ready-to-eat  pizza products.  As of year-end 1996,
the concept had grown to more than 12,300 units.

   
        In 1996,  worldwide  system sales exceeded $7.4 billion;  however,  U.S.
same  store  sales at  Company-operated  units  decreased  4%  reflecting  fewer
transactions.  In contrast,  U.S. same store sales at Company-operated units had
increased a solid 4% in 1995 driven by the introduction of new products, such as
Stuffed  Crust  Pizza.   In  the  first  half  of  1997,  same  store  sales  at
Company-operated units in the U.S. declined 7% at Pizza Hut. This reflects an 8%
decline in the first  quarter and a 5% decline in the second.  In the first four
weeks of the third quarter,  however, same store sales were once again achieving
positive growth over the prior year. Average U.S.  system-wide sales per unit in
1996 were $620,000.
    

        For ten of the last twelve  years,  Pizza Hut was named Best Pizza Chain
in America in the "Choice in Chains" national consumer survey published annually
by RESTAURANTS &amp; INSTITUTIONS MAGAZINE.  Also, the January 1997 CONSUMER REPORTS
named Pizza Hut as the best pizza chain in America.

        Taco Bell

        Taco Bell operates under the name "Taco Bell" and specializes in Mexican
style food  products,  including  various types of tacos and  burritos,  salads,
nachos and other related  items.  The first Taco Bell  restaurant  was opened in
1962 by Glen  Bell in  Downey,  California,  and in 1964  the  first  Taco  Bell
franchise  was sold.  By 1978,  when it was  acquired by PepsiCo,  the Taco Bell
system had grown to approximately  1,000 units.  

</p><p class="break">  12


Today, Taco Bell dominates the U.S. Mexican QSR segment. Taco Bell units feature
a distinctive bell logo on their signage.
   
        By  year-end  1996,  there  were more than  6,800  Taco Bell units in 17
countries and territories, with system-wide sales of $4.7 billion. After several
years of having  achieved above industry  average growth rates,  U.S. same store
sales at  Company-operated  Taco Bell units declined 2% and 4% in 1996 and 1995,
respectively, as a result of lower transaction counts. For each of the first two
quarters of 1997, however, same store sales growth for Company-operated units in
the U.S.  was  positive  resulting  in a 3% growth  rate for the  entire 24 week
period. Average U.S. system-wide sales per unit in 1996 were $886,000.
    

Operating Structure

          For all three of its concepts, TRICON structures it's sales operations
in two primary  ways.  The units are either owned and operated by the Company or
they are owned and operated by independent  franchisees  which can range in size
from individuals owning just a few units to large publicly-traded  companies. In
addition, TRICON has established international joint ventures between itself and
third  parties.  As of  year-end  1996,  44% of  TRICON's  worldwide  units were
operated by the Company  and joint ventures in which the Company  participates,
45% by franchisees, and 11% by licensees.

          Although  the  margins  on the  franchise  side  of the  business  are
significantly  higher than on the  Company-operated  side of the  business,  the
owner-operator  can also enjoy  significant  upside  opportunities  when average
sales per store are  growing.  TRICON  believes  that one of the key  factors in
driving up average  sales per store is the  ability  of the  restaurant  general
manager (the "RGM"), whether a TRICON employee or a franchisee,  to remain close
to his customer and his restaurant crew.

   
        In order to ensure that RGMs can achieve  this,  there are two important
initiatives  underway  at  TRICON.  The  first  is a  program  to sell  selected
Company-operated restaurants to franchisees ("refranchising").  Two years ago it
was  determined  that  there was a need to  rebalance  the  system  more  toward
franchisees.  As of year-end 1996,  over 900 stores had been  refranchised  as a
part of that program, the large majority to franchisees that were already in the
TRICON  system.  The second  initiative,  called "RGM is No. 1", is a program to
focus the Company-operated  system to more consciously support the effort of the
RGM. See "Business of TRICON - Human Resources and Management."
    

          It is  critical to TRICON to  maintain  strong and open  relationships
with its franchisees and their  representatives.  To this end, TRICON  invests a
significant  amount of time  working  with the  franchisee  community  and their
representative  organizations  on all aspects of the business,  ranging from new
products to new equipment to new management techniques. As the Company continues
to refranchise  Company-operated  units and franchisees play a larger and larger
role in the growth of the business,  it is expected that these  activities  will
continue to grow in importance.

Human Resources and Management

        Led by Andrall Pearson and David Novak,  TRICON has a strong  management
team with a proven track record in the food service  industry.  Mr. Pearson most
recently  served as an  operating  partner of  Clayton  Dubilier &amp; Rice where he
played an important role in the performance improvement of a number of portfolio
companies.  From 1985 to 1993 Mr.  Pearson  was a tenured  professor  at Harvard
Business  School  and from 1971 to 1984 he was  President  and  Chief  Operating
Officer of PepsiCo  where he was  instrumental  in acquiring  and  expanding the
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant chains.

   
        David Novak most recently  served as Group President and Chief Executive
Officer of KFC and Pizza Hut where he led a significant  turnaround of KFC which
has  now  had  ten   consecutive   quarters  of  same  store  sales   growth  at
Company-operated  units.  See  "Management  of TRICON - Executive  Officers" and
"Management of TRICON - Senior  Operating  Management"  for a description of the
experience of other members of the TRICON management team.
    

        TRICON   believes   that  high  quality,   customer-focused   restaurant
management  is critical to its  long-term  success.  It also  believes  that its
leadership  position,  strong  results-oriented  and  recognition  culture,  and
various training and incentive programs help attract and retain highly motivated
RGM's  who  are  committed  to  providing  superior  customer  satisfaction  and
outstanding  business  results.  The Company believes that having a high quality
restaurant  manager in a unit for a  meaningful  tenure is  probably  the single
largest factor in a unit's  achieving  excellent  results in the areas of sales,
profits and overall guest satisfaction.

</p><p class="break"> 14


        The Company's restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit
size.  Generally,  each  restaurant is led by an RGM,  together with one or more
additional  assistant managers,  depending on the operating complexity and sales
volume of the restaurant.  Each restaurant  usually has between 10 and 35 hourly
employees,  most of whom work part-time.  The Company's four operating divisions
each issue detailed manuals covering all aspects of their respective operations,
including food handling and product preparation  procedures,  safety and quality
issues, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting procedures. The
restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each
unit and for ensuring compliance with operating  standards.  RGMs report to area
managers, who are each responsible for approximately nine to eleven restaurants.
The Company's  restaurants are visited from time to time by various higher level
supervisors  within their  respective  organizations to help ensure adherence to
system standards.

          RGMs are required to attend and complete their  respective  division's
training  programs.  These  programs  consist  of initial  training,  as well as
additional  continuing  development and training programs that may be offered or
required from time to time.  Initial manager training programs generally last at
least six weeks,  and emphasize  leadership,  business  management,  supervisory
skills (including training,  coaching, and recruiting),  product preparation and
production,  safety, quality control,  customer service,  labor management,  and
equipment maintenance.

   
        At  year-end  1996,  TRICON  employed   approximately  335,000  persons,
approximately  245,000 of whom were part-time  employees.  Approximately  75% of
TRICON's  employees are employed in the United States. The Company believes that
it provides  working  conditions and  compensation  that compare  favorably with
those of its principal competitors.  Employees, other than restaurant management
and corporate management,  are paid on an hourly basis. Less than 1% of TRICON's
U.S.  employees  are  covered  by  collective  bargaining  agreements.  TRICON's
non-U.S.  employees are subject to numerous  labor council  relationships  which
vary due to the  diverse  cultures in which the  Company  operates.  The Company
considers its employee relations to be good.
    

Industry Overview

        Worldwide

        The food service  industry is defined as food fully  prepared  away from
home.  The  categories  included  within this  industry  are QSRs,  full service
restaurants,   other   commercial   restaurants   (including   cafeterias)   and
non-commercial  restaurants such as those in schools and hospitals. In 1996, the
QSR segment of the  industry,  which is the one in which  TRICON  operates,  was
estimated to be $160 billion.

   
        TRICON is the world's leading  restaurant company in units and second in
system-wide  sales.  Based on the number of units,  TRICON's worldwide system is
about 40% larger  than  McDonald's  and more than three times the size of Burger
King's.  In  1996,   TRICON's  worldwide  system  sales  exceeded  $20  billion,
accounting for 13% of the estimated $160 billion global QSR market. In addition,
TRICON's  brands  are  leaders  in  units and  sales in  their  respective  food
categories.

United States

   
        In the  U.S.,  one of the  most  important  factors  affecting  the food
service  industry has been  consumers'  growing desire for meals that are quick,
easy and convenient, which often means food prepared and consumed outside of the
home.  According to McKinsey &amp; Company,  Inc., in the U.S. today almost 45 cents
of the  consumer's  food dollar goes to meals  prepared and served  ready-to-eat
away from  home,  up from 38 cents ten years ago.  By  year-end  1996,  the food
service  industry had reached $321 billion in sales. The QSR segment of the food
service  industry  has been growing  rapidly,  with a ten year  compound  annual
growth  rate of more than 6%. The main  driver of growth over the last two years
has been new unit  expansion,  primarily on the part of the major chains,  which
increased at a rate of 4% annually.

Other Commercial               14%

        As a result of new unit  expansion in excess of population  growth,  the
number of QSR restaurants has increased from 1 for every 1,672 people in 1986 to
1 for  every  1,343  people  in 1996.  Consumer  demand  as  measured  by eating
occasions has not

</p><p class="break"> 16

kept pace with unit  expansion  which has  resulted  in  pressure  on same store
sales.  The competitive  QSR segment of the food service  industry has therefore
become increasingly challenging and store level margins are being pressured, not
only from the lack of sales growth, but also from increasing commodity costs and
higher wage rates due to low unemployment and increased minimum wages.

          In the United  States,  TRICON is the  largest  restaurant  company in
terms of number of units. It has over 20,000 system-wide units located in all 50
states.  As of year-end 1996, the  composition by concept was 25% KFC, 43% Pizza
Hut and 32% Taco Bell. Over the past five years,  TRICON's units in the U.S. and
U.S. system-wide sales have both grown at a compound annual growth rate of 6%.

        International

          Outside  the  United  States,  sales  in the QSR  segment  of the food
service  industry are estimated to be $62 billion.  Industry  conditions vary by
country,  with many local  restaurants  and fast food  options  present,  but on
average competition is less than in the United States as internationally branded
competition  is  generally  limited  to  McDonald's  and,  in  certain  markets,
Domino's, Wendy's and Burger King.

        In addition,  branded QSR units per  population  in most  countries  are
generally well below that of the United States.

        Since  late  1994,  the  international   operations  of  TRICON's  three
restaurant  concepts  have  been  consolidated  into  a  separate  international
division to improve focus and scale.  TRICON  International  has  redirected its
focus to generate more system growth through  franchisees  and  concentrate  its
development of  Company-operated  stores in those markets with sufficient scale.
TRICON  International  has  developed new global  systems and tools  designed to
improve marketing, operations consistency, product delivery, market planning and
development, franchise support, and store-level team building capability.

Competitive Advantages

        Global Scale

   
        Powerful  Concepts in Growing Food  Categories.  KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell  are  three  of  the  most  recognized  restaurant  concepts,  each  having
significant  value. Each is the U.S. leader in units and sales in its respective
food category. TRICON believes that the near universal appeal of chicken and the
enormous  variety  of pizzas  provide a strong  foundation  for  global  concept
expansion,  and the  emerging  trend  towards  Mexican-style  foods may  provide
additional growth opportunities.
    

        Worldwide  Capabilities.  TRICON has global  scale and  capabilities  in
marketing,  advertising,  purchasing, research and development ("R&amp;D"), and site
selection.  TRICON believes that its worldwide  network of Company and franchise
operations  provides  a strong  foundation  from  which to  expand  in  existing
markets,  enter new markets,  launch new products and  marketing  campaigns  and
introduce new concepts.  In many  countries and regions  TRICON has the scale to
use extensive  television  advertising,  an important factor in increasing brand
awareness.  TRICON's scale enables it to negotiate superior marketing promotions
and real estate transactions compared to many of its competitors.

        Purchasing/Distribution.  The Company is a  substantial  purchaser  of a
number of food  products,  and it  believes  its scale  purchasing  capabilities
provide  it with  competitive  advantages,  such as it's  ability  to  ensure  a
consistent  supply of high  quality  food,  ingredients  and other  supplies  at
competitive  prices  to all of  its  restaurant  concepts.  To  ensure  reliable
sources, in 1996, the Company consolidated most of its worldwide food and supply
procurement  activities under a new  organization  called  SmartSourcing,  which
sources,  negotiates  and buys  specified  food and  supplies  from  hundreds of
suppliers in over 70 countries and territories. The SmartSourcing staff develops
long-term  relationships or partnerships  with key vendors.  They monitor market
trends and seek to identify and capitalize on purchasing opportunities that will
enhance the Company's  competitive  position.  The principal  products purchased
include beef,  cheese,  chicken products,  cooking oils, corn,  flour,  lettuce,
pinto  beans,  pork,  seasonings,  tomato  products,  and  paper  and  packaging
materials.

        To ensure the wholesomeness of all food products, suppliers are required
to meet or exceed strict quality control standards.  Competitive bids, long-term
contracts  and  long-term  vendor   relationships   have  been  used  to  ensure
availability  of  products.  TRICON  has also  entered  into  commodity  futures
contracts  traded on national  exchanges  with the  objective  of reducing  food
costs.  While such  hedging  activity  has  historically  been done on a limited
basis, hedging activity could increase in the future if TRICON believes it would
result in lower total costs.  The Company has not  experienced  any  significant
continuous shortages of supplies.  Prices paid for these supplies may be subject
to fluctuation;  when prices  increase,  the Company may be able to pass on such
increases to its  customers,  although there is no assurance this can be done in
the future.
   
          Many food products,  paper and packaging supplies,  and equipment used
in  the  operation  of the  Company's  restaurants,  have  been  distributed  to
individual  Company-operated  units by PFS, which had been PepsiCo's  restaurant
distributor  operation.  PFS 

</p><p class="break">  20


also sold and distributed these same items to many franchised and licensed units
that operate in the three restaurant  systems,  though  principally to Pizza Hut
and Taco Bell franchised/licensed  units in the United States. In May 1997, KFC,
Pizza  Hut and  Taco  Bell  entered  into a five  year  Sales  and  Distribution
Agreement  with PFS to  purchase  the  majority of their food and  supplies  for
Company-operated   stores,  subject  to  PFS  maintaining  certain  quality  and
performance  levels. The Sales and Distribution  Agreement became effective upon
the  closing  of the  sale by  PepsiCo  of the  assets  and  business  of PFS to
AmeriServe  Food  Distribution,  Inc.  ("AmeriServe"),  a subsidiary  of Holberg
Industries,  Inc., pursuant to a definitive  agreement dated as of May 23, 1997,
as  amended.  KFC,  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell have also  entered  into  multi-year
agreements with  Pepsi-Cola  Company  regarding the sale of Pepsi-Cola  beverage
products at U.S.  Company-operated  units. See "The  Distribution - Relationship
Between PepsiCo and TRICON after the Distribution." 
    

          Management  Information  Systems.  TRICON considers itself a leader in
the utilization of technology to help manage its  restaurants.  Systems targeted
at improving financial controls,  cost management,  product inventory,  consumer
service and employee effectiveness have been implemented in all Company-operated
units. In the U.S.,  communication  networks  transmit critical business data to
and from the  Company-operated  units. These networks provide timely information
on daily business  activity.  The Company uses  proprietary  software as well as
purchased  software to simplify the  restaurants'  processes and  administrative
requirements. The leveraging of technology allows the RGMs to focus on customers
and operations.

        Proven Operating Record

          Core  Competence in Marketing.  TRICON has strong  marketing teams and
strong agencies as its partners.  In 1996,  TRICON and its franchisees  invested
more than $745 million in the U.S.  and more than $310 million in  international
markets in advertising and marketing programs.

        TRICON   believes   that  it  has  developed   significant   advertising
capabilities,  and  has  been  able  to  generate  substantial  interest  in and
excitement around its brands. Many of the Company's  advertising  campaigns have
been  recognized  in  the  past  with  awards  acknowledging  their  creativity,
execution  or  achievements  in creating or  maintaining  brand  awareness.  The
Company's  size  enables  it to be a  leading  advertiser  in the  food  service
industry,  which it can  leverage  to achieve  efficiency  of  national  network
television  advertising,  supplemented with local market television advertising.
TRICON's four operating  divisions  implement  periodic  promotions as they deem
appropriate  or desirable in order to maintain and increase their sales and unit
profits.  They also  rely on  radio,  newspaper  and  other  print  advertising,
in-store point of purchase advertising,  and direct mail and newspaper couponing
programs, to attract customers and encourage the purchase of their products. The
Company has developed and utilizes  sophisticated  marketing research techniques
to measure customer satisfaction and consumer trends.

        Quality Assurance. The Quality Assurance Departments at each of TRICON's
four operating divisions help ensure that the systems'  restaurants provide high
quality,  wholesome food products in clean and safe  environments.  The systems'
restaurants  


</p><p class="break">  21

are required to buy food supplies,  ingredients,  seasonings, and equipment only
from approved  suppliers,  who are required to meet or exceed  system  standards
designed to ensure product quality,  safety and consistency.  From time to time,
the Quality Assurance  Departments inspect the facilities of their suppliers and
request samples for testing and other quality  control  monitoring and measures.
Many of these  suppliers,  such as poultry  producers,  are also subject to some
government  inspection.  In addition,  representatives  of the Quality Assurance
Departments  visit restaurants from time to time to ensure that food is properly
stored,  handled and  prepared  in  accordance  with  prescribed  standards  and
specifications,  as well as to provide  training in food  safety and  sanitation
measures to the restaurant operators. The Quality Assurance Departments are also
responsible  for  remaining  current  on  issues  related  to food  safety,  and
interacting  with  regulatory  agencies as may be required or desirable on these
matters.

Strong Free Cash Flow

   
        TRICON has generated  significant  free cash flow through its operations
and  global  refranchising   program  under  which  it  sells   Company-operated
restaurants  to  current  and new  franchisees.  Since  the  strategy  began  in
mid-1995,  TRICON refranchised 264 and 640 units in 1995 and 1996, respectively.
In June 1997, TRICON International sold 77 KFCs, 43 Pizza Huts and two joint KFC
and  Pizza Hut  delivery/carryout  units in New  Zealand  in an  initial  public
offering.  As a result of  TRICON's  refranchising  activity,  coupled  with new
points of  distribution  added by  franchisees  and licensees and the program to
upgrade the asset portfolio by closing  under-performing  stores,  the Company's
overall ownership of total system units (i.e. Company-operated and joint venture
units in which the Company  participates)  declined six percentage points in two
years from 50% at  year-end  1994 to 44% at  year-end  1996.  The  refranchising
program is  expected  to  continue.  However,  the  continuation  of the program
depends on the  Company's  ability to find  qualified  franchisees  to  purchase
Company-operated   restaurants  at  prices  considered  by  the  Company  to  be
appropriate.
    

        TRICON's  operations  generated free cash flow of almost $465 million in
1996,  allowing it to increase its rate of investment in the following:  product
innovation  and  quality;  improved  operating  platforms  leading  to  improved
service;  store-level human resources including recruiting and training; testing
alternative  modes  of  distribution;   and  creative  marketing  programs.  See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis."

        United States Growth Opportunities

        TRICON  believes it has many  opportunities  to achieve same store sales
growth at Company-operated units in its U.S. business due to the following:

   
        Daypart  Expansion.  TRICON's  strengths  in  market  research  and R&amp;D,
combined  with  underdeveloped  dayparts in all three core  concepts  give it an
opportunity to increase the average sales per unit.  According to CREST, in 1996
in the U.S. almost two-thirds of  KFC and approximately  three-quarters of Pizza
Hut  Company-operated  store sales occurred during the dinner occasion.  At Taco
Bell approximately half of U.S. Company-operated store sales occurred during the
lunch  occasion,  with about 44%  occurring at dinner and the  remainder  during
snacking hours.
    

</p><p class="break"> 22

        Channel Expansion.  TRICON's products, especially chicken and pizza, are
well suited to delivery  because their  relatively long holding times allow them
to be  delivered  hot and ready to eat.  Today,  Pizza Hut has a  well-developed
delivery system and almost 500 KFC units currently offer some delivery services.
In addition,  the Company believes there is opportunity to innovate with respect
to the type of unit that best  meets  consumer  needs.  Some of the  alternative
channels that are being  developed  include  non-traditional  units such as Taco
Bell  Express in venues like  shopping  malls,  food courts,  airports,  gas and
convenience stores and schools.

        International Growth Opportunities

        Underdeveloped   Presence  in  Many   Countries.   Although  TRICON  has
established a presence in many  countries,  the majority of those  countries are
still  underpenetrated  considering not only population size and growth but also
in terms of per capita  purchasing power.  TRICON has demonstrated  considerable
success in Asian  emerging  markets with some of the largest stores in the world
on a sales per store basis being operated by it in China. In countries which are
more  developed,  the ratio of stores per million people is still far below that
found in the U.S.  and there is still  tremendous  opportunity  to  leverage  an
increasing demand for convenient, fully prepared foods.

   
        Scale Advantages.  TRICON has the ability to leverage not only the scale
advantages of purchasing and R&amp;D but also the experience of its U.S. business to
quickly  identify new product  opportunities  for local markets.  As of year-end
1996, TRICON's  international  system-wide sales accounted for approximately 11%
of all international QSR sales.
    

Other

        Properties

   
     As of year-end 1996, KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell owned approximately 3,200
and leased  approximately 6,200 restaurants,  delivery/carryout  units and other
food  service  units  in the  United  States;  and  TRICON  International  owned
approximately 1,000 and leased  approximately 1,500 additional units outside the
United  States.  KFC,  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  restaurants in the United States
which are not owned are  generally  leased for initial  terms of 15 or 20 years,
and generally have renewal options,  while Pizza Hut delivery/carryout  units in
the United States generally are leased for  significantly  shorter initial terms
with short renewal options.  Joint ventures in which KFC, Pizza Hut or Taco Bell
are partners and other consolidated  entities own or lease  approximately  1,000
restaurants  or units  outside  the United  States.  TRICON  leases  Pizza Hut's
corporate  headquarters  in  Dallas,  Texas.  Taco  Bell  leases  its  corporate
headquarters in Irvine, California and KFC owns its corporate headquarters and a
research facility in Louisville, Kentucky. In addition, TRICON owns major office
facilities  in  Wichita,  Kansas and leases an office  facility  for  accounting
services in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
    
</p><p class="break"> 23

        Competition

        The overall  food  service  industry  and the QSR segment are  intensely
competitive  with  respect  to  food  quality,   price,  service,   convenience,
restaurant  location and concept.  The restaurant  business is often affected by
changes in consumer  tastes;  national,  regional or local economic  conditions;
demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing
restaurants; and disposable purchasing power. TRICON competes within each market
with national and regional chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only
for customers,  but also for  management and hourly  personnel and suitable real
estate sites. For additional information on competition, see "Business of TRICON
- Industry Overview."


        Trademarks

   
        TRICON regards its Kentucky Fried Chicken  (Registered  Trademark),  KFC
(Registered   Trademark),   Pizza  Hut  (Registered  Trademark)  and  Taco  Bell
(Registered  Trademark)  trademarks  as  having  significant  value and as being
important  in  marketing  to  consumers.  The  Company's  policy  is  to  pursue
registration  of its  important  trademarks  whenever  possible  and  to  oppose
vigorously  any  infringement  of its  trademarks.  The  use  of  the  foregoing
trademarks by  franchisees  and licensees has been  authorized in KFC, Pizza Hut
and Taco Bell  franchise  and  license  agreements.  Under  current law and with
proper use, the Company's rights in its trademarks can last indefinitely.
    

        Government Regulation

        United  States.  TRICON is subject to various  Federal,  state and local
laws affecting its business.  Each of the Company's restaurants must comply with
licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities,  which include
health,  sanitation,  safety and fire agencies in the state or  municipality  in
which the restaurant is located. To date, the Company has not been significantly
affected  by any  difficulty,  delay or failure to obtain  required  licenses or
approvals.

        A small portion of Pizza Hut's net sales are attributable to the sale of
beer and wine.  A  license  is  required  for each  site  that  sells  alcoholic
beverages  (in most cases,  on an annual  basis) and  licenses may be revoked or
suspended  for cause at any time.  Regulations  governing  the sale of alcoholic
beverages relate to many aspects of restaurant operations, including the minimum
age of  patrons  and  employees,  hours  of  operation,  advertising,  wholesale
purchasing,  inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic
beverages. The failure of a restaurant which sells alcoholic beverages to obtain
or retain these licenses may adversely affect such restaurant's operations.

        The  Company  is also  subject to Federal  and state  minimum  wage laws
governing such matters as overtime,  tip credits and working  conditions.  Since
the bulk of the Company's employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related
to the Federal minimum wage,  increases in the minimum wage could  significantly
increase the Company's labor costs.

        The Company is also subject to Federal and state child labor laws which,
among  other  things,  prohibit  the use of  certain  "hazardous  equipment"  by
employees  18  years  

</p><p class="break">  24

of age or  younger.  The  Company  has not to  date  been  materially  adversely
affected by such laws.

        The Company is subject to Federal and state  environmental  regulations,
but these rules have not had a material effect on the Company's operations.  The
Company  continues to monitor its facilities  for compliance  with the Americans
With Disabilities Act ("ADA") in order to conform to its requirements. Under the
ADA, the Company could be required to expend funds to modify its  restaurants to
better provide service to, or make reasonable  accommodation  for the employment
of, disabled persons.

          International.  Internationally, the Company's restaurants are subject
to national and local laws and regulations  which are similar to those affecting
the Company's domestic  restaurants,  including laws and regulations  concerning
labor,  health,  sanitation and safety.  The international  restaurants are also
subject to tariffs and  regulations  on imported  commodities  and equipment and
laws regulating foreign investment.

        Worldwide  compliance  with  environmental  regulations  has  not  had a
material  adverse  effect on the Company's  earnings,  capital  expenditures  or
competitive position.

        Legal Proceedings

        The Company is subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to
lawsuits,  taxes, real estate,  the environment and other matters arising out of
the normal course of business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability,
if any,  in excess of  amounts  already  provided  for,  is not likely to have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  annual  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.

        Sale of Non-Core Concepts

   
        In late  1996,  TRICON  set a  strategy  to focus  human  and  financial
resources on growing the sales and  profitability of its three core QSR concepts
- KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The non-core restaurant businesses of Hot 'n Now
("HNN"),  East Side Mario's  ("ESM") and Chevys Mexican  Restaurants  ("Chevys")
were  sold in 1997,  and two  other  non-core  restaurant  businesses,  D'Angelo
Sandwich Shops  ("D'Angelo") and California Pizza Kitchen ("CPK"),  are expected
to be  sold  prior  to the  Distribution  Date.  These  five  "non-core"  chains
represented  approximately  4% of TRICON's  worldwide sales at  Company-operated
units in 1996. See "Combined Financial Statements."
    


                        SELECTED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

   

        For purposes of the following  selected combined  financial data, TRICON
includes  the  worldwide  operations  of KFC,  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (its core
business),  and its non-core U.S.  businesses  through their respectice dates of
disposal.

        The following  selected combined financial data of TRICON should be read
in  conjunction  with,  and is qualified  in its  entirety by reference  to, the
audited  Combined  Financial  Statements  and the unaudited  Condensed  Combined
Financial  Statements  and the related  notes  thereto  included on pages F-2 to
F-29.

</p><p class="break">  25

        The pro forma  selected  financial  data set forth below is derived from
the unaudited Pro Forma Condensed  Combined  Financial  Information  included on
pages  F-30 to F-34.  The pro forma  data does not  purport  to  represent  what
TRICON's  financial  position  or results of  operations  would have been had it
operated  as a  separate,  independent  company  nor does it give  effect to any
events other than those discussed in the related notes.  The pro forma data also
does not purport to project TRICON's financial position or results of operations
as of any future date or for any future period.

        The  capital  structure  that  existed  when  the  Company's  businesses
operated as part of PepsiCo is not relevant because it does not reflect TRICON's
expected  future  capital   structure  as  a  separate,   independent   company.
Accordingly,  per share data for  earnings and cash  dividends  declared has not
been  presented  except  for pro forma  earnings  per  share for the  year-ended
December 28, 1996 and the 24 weeks ended June 14,  1997,  which was based on 155
million shares and equivalents.

TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)  Reflects the following pro forma adjustments:

     1.   Elimination  of  TRICON's  non-core  U.S.  businesses  disposed  of or
          expected to be disposed of in 1997;

     2.   Expected debt to be issued to fund repayment of certain amounts due to
          PepsiCo and a dividend to PepsiCo;

     3.   Record TRICON's equity and shares outstanding; and

     4.   Adjust interest expense to reflect expected debt outstanding as of the
          Distribution Date.

(b)  Included unusual charges of $246 ($189  after-tax)  related to the decision
     to dispose of TRICON's non-core U.S. businesses.  See Note 3 to the audited
     Combined  Financial  Statements on page F-11.  Also included the benefit of
     reduced  depreciation and amortization expense for the first three quarters
     of 1996 of $40  ($26  after-tax)  as a  result  of the  initial  impact  of
     adopting  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),
     "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived
     Assets to Be Disposed Of," at the beginning of the fourth  quarter of 1995.
     See (c) below.

(c)  Included net facility actions:

                                     1996             1995              1994

     The initial, non-cash impairment charge of $457 ($324 after-tax) in 1995
     was due to the  adoption  of SFAS  121 at the  beginning  of the  fourth
     quarter. As a result of the reduced carrying amount of restaurants to be
     held and used in the business, depreciation and amortization expense for
     the fourth quarter of 1995 was reduced by $17 ($12 after-tax).  See Note
     3 to the audited Combined Financial Statements on page F-11.

(d)  Included a benefit of changing to a  preferable  method for  calculating
     the market-related  value of pension plan assets used in determining the
     return-on-asset  component  of annual  pension  expense,  which  reduced
     full-year pension expense in 1994 by $5 ($3 after-tax).

(e)  Fiscal year 1994 consisted of 53 weeks.  Normally,  fiscal years consist
     of 52 weeks; however,  because the fiscal year ends on the last Saturday
     in December,  a week is added every 5 or 6 years.  The fifty-third  week
     increased 1994 revenues by $172 and earnings by  approximately  $23 ($14
     after-tax).

(f)  Included a $7 charge to increase  net deferred  tax  liabilities  as of the
     beginning of 1993 for a 1% statutory  income tax rate  increase due to 1993
     U.S. Federal tax legislation.

        *  Because  TRICON  allocates its income tax expense to interim  periods
           based  on  a  forecasted   full-year  effective  tax  rate,  the  tax
           attributes  associated with these net facility  actions will continue
           to be  recognized  in TRICON's  tax  expense  over the balance of the
           year.  Accordingly,  the  after-tax  gain  recognized in the 24 weeks
           ended 1997 and 1996 is lower than the full-year amount.

           The  1997 full-year after-tax gain reflects the tax free gain from
           the refranchising  of TRICON's  restaurants  in New Zealand to a new,
           independent publicly-traded company.

(h)  Represented  the  cumulative  effect  of  adopting  in  1994  Statement  of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112),  "Employers'  Accounting
     for  Postemployment  Benefits,"  and  changing to a  preferable  method for
     calculating  the  market-related  value  of  pension  plan  assets  used in
     determining the return-on-asset component of annual pension expense and the
     cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization (see Notes
     13 and 11 to the audited  Combined  Financial  Statements on page F-16) and
     adopting in 1992 Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS
     106),  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Postretirement   Benefits  Other  Than
     Pensions" which reduced earnings by $31 ($19 after-tax).

(i)  For the  historical  results of  operations  net income  included  interest
     expense based upon PepsiCo's weighted average borrowing rate applied to the
     average  balance of  investments by and advances from PepsiCo to TRICON and
     interest on its external third-party debt.

(j)  Pro forma shares and  equivalents  of 155 million used to compute  earnings
     per share was based on 152 million  shares of TRICON common stock  adjusted
     for the dilutive effect of stock options.  The 152 million shares reflected
     an estimate of the shares to be issued at the Distribution  Date based on a
     distribution ratio of one share of TRICON Common Stock for every ten shares
     of PepsiCo Capital Stock.

(k)  Long-term debt represented external third-party debt.
    
</p><p class="break">  30

                                    FINANCING

        PepsiCo's  general practice has been to incur debt at the parent company
level rather than the subsidiary  level,  even when the funds obtained from such
borrowings have been used in the businesses of its  subsidiaries,  except in the
case  of  capital  leases,  assumed  debt of  acquired  businesses  and  certain
international  third  party  debt  which  generally  have been  incurred  at the
subsidiary  level.  Accordingly,  the financing  requirements  of the restaurant
businesses  generally  have  been  funded  through  intercompany  accounts  with
PepsiCo.

   
        Prior to the Distribution,  TRICON will incur approximately $4.5 billion
of debt obligations.  Substantially all of the proceeds of such debt obligations
will be  transferred  to PepsiCo as repayment of certain  amounts due to PepsiCo
from TRICON and a dividend. The remainder of any investment in TRICON by PepsiCo
will be reclassified  from  "Investment by and advances from PepsiCo" to "Common
Stock  and  surplus"  on the  TRICON  balance  sheet.  This  remainder  will  be
contributed by PepsiCo to its  shareholders  in the form of TRICON Common Stock.
PepsiCo will retain no equity interest in TRICON. However, immediately after the
Distribution  Date,  TRICON  shares will be owned by PepsiCo's  pension trust on
behalf of PepsiCo's employees.

        TRICON has no assurance that, as an independent company, it will be able
to obtain financing upon terms as favorable as those historically experienced by
PepsiCo.

Commercial Paper Program

        TRICON is planning to establish a commercial  paper program at such time
as TRICON's  management  believes  its credit  rating  supports  such a program.
Borrowings  under this  program  may be used to finance a base level of floating
rate debt and seasonal borrowing needs.

Bank Credit Facilities

        TRICON is planning to establish a senior,  unsecured five-year term loan
facility in the aggregate amount of $2 billion and a senior, unsecured five-year
revolving credit and multicurrency competitive advance facility in the aggregate
amount of $3.5  billion.  A portion of the latter  facility will be available in
the form of letters of credit.  Interest  rates are  expected to be based on the
London interbank  offered rate ("LIBOR").  The facilities are expected to have a
quarterly  facility  fee  as  well  as a  semi-annual  administrative  fee.  The
covenants  in the  facilities  will be  carefully  negotiated  with  respect  to
TRICON's debt and investment requirements. TRICON believes it will have adequate
flexibility  under  the  covenants  and that they  should  not  impose  material
restrictions on TRICON's operations.

Long-Term Debt

        TRICON's  management may refinance a portion of the bank borrowings with
long-term financing when market conditions are deemed appropriate  following the
Distribution. TRICON may file a shelf registration statement with the Securities
and  Exchange  Commission  providing  for the issuance of debt  securities  with
various terms, conditions and maturities. Interest rates would be expected to be
based on market

</p><p class="break"> 31


conditions at the time of the  offerings.  The covenants in the indenture  under
which such debt  securities  would be issued would be carefully  negotiated with
respect to TRICON's debt and investment requirements.

Derivative Instruments

        TRICON is currently  planning to enter into  agreements  with a selected
number of creditworthy  financial institutions which will enable TRICON to enter
into  interest  rate  swap  agreements  in order to  reduce  its  interest  rate
exposure. TRICON will likely use interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on
50% to 80% of the amounts outstanding under its bank facilities.

    
                                THE DISTRIBUTION

Reasons for the Distribution

          PepsiCo's  management has proposed the  Distribution  to achieve three
specific business objectives: (i) to alleviate competitive barriers to expanding
its fountain beverage business;  (ii) to allow PepsiCo to focus its attention on
its packaged goods  businesses,  Pepsi-Cola  and Frito-Lay;  and (iii) to permit
PepsiCo and TRICON to offer  management  incentives  more  directly  tied to the
performance of their respective  businesses.  PepsiCo is distributing the shares
of  TRICON  to  its  shareholders  based  on  its  belief  that  the  restaurant
businesses,  on the one hand, and PepsiCo's  packaged goods  businesses,  on the
other  hand,   represent   different   business   propositions.   They   involve
fundamentally  different growth  opportunities,  financial  returns,  investment
requirements,  operating systems and people dynamics. PepsiCo also believes that
corporations perform optimally when business strategy, organization and employee
incentives are more narrowly focused.

        Accordingly,  PepsiCo has concluded that the long-term interests of both
businesses are best served through the creation of two separate, independent and
focused corporations,  TRICON focused on restaurants and a "new PepsiCo" focused
on packaged goods.

Manner of Effecting the Distribution

   
        On or before the Distribution Date, PepsiCo will transfer to BankBoston,
N.A.,  as  Distribution  agent (the  "Distribution  Agent"),  for the benefit of
holders of record of PepsiCo Capital Stock at the close of business on September
19, 1997 (the "Record  Date"),  all shares of TRICON  Common Stock then owned by
PepsiCo.

        The  Distribution  will be made to holders of record of PepsiCo  Capital
Stock at the close of business  on the Record  Date,  without any  consideration
being paid by such holders, on the basis of one share of TRICON Common Stock for
every ten shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock held on the Record Date.  TRICON will
participate in the Direct  Registration  System to effect the Distribution,  and
shares of TRICON Common Stock will be  distributed  to PepsiCo  shareholders  in
book-entry form.  Commencing on or about the Distribution Date, the Distribution
Agent will begin mailing account  statements  reflecting  ownership of shares of
TRICON  Common Stock to such  holders of record of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock.  Any
TRICON shareholders that would like to receive a 

</p><p class="break"> 32

certificate  representing  their shares may contact the Distribution  Agent. The
shares of TRICON  Common  Stock  will be fully  paid and  nonassessable  and the
holders thereof will not be entitled to preemptive  rights.  See "Description of
TRICON Capital Stock - TRICON Common Stock."
    
         No fractional  shares will be distributed as part of the  Distribution,
other  than  fractional  shares  which  will  be  credited  to the  accounts  of
participants in certain PepsiCo plans as described below. The Distribution Agent
will aggregate  fractional shares, other than those held by participants in such
plans, into whole shares of TRICON Common Stock and sell them on the open market
at  prevailing  prices on behalf of holders who would  otherwise  be entitled to
receive such fractional share interests. Any such persons entitled to receive at
least  $0.01 will  receive a cash  payment  for their  portion of the total sale
proceeds.  Any  persons  entitled  to receive  less than  $0.01 will have their
fractional shares canceled.

     Distribution  of TRICON Common Stock with respect to PepsiCo  Capital Stock
held in the  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  Purchase  Plan,  the  PepsiCo  SaveUp Plan
(formerly 401(k) or Long-Term Savings),  the PepsiCo Dividend  Reinvestment Plan
and  the  PepsiCo   Employees'   Stock   Ownership  Plan  will  be  credited  to
participants' accounts.  Fractional shares will be credited with respect to each
of these plans other than the PepsiCo  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan.  Fractional
shares with respect to the PepsiCo Dividend Reinvestment Plan will be cashed out
as described in the previous paragraph.

   
        The  Distribution is subject to a number of conditions,  including (i) a
favorable ruling of the Internal Revenue Service  concerning the tax-free nature
of  the   Distribution,   (ii)  appropriate  stock  market  conditions  for  the
Distribution, (iii) various regulatory approvals, and (iv) approval by PepsiCo's
Board of Directors of the final terms of the  Distribution,  including,  without
limitation,  the formal declaration of a dividend to PepsiCo's  shareholders and
other specific actions necessary to the Distribution.  The conditions in clauses
(i),  (ii) and (iv)  above have been  satisfied.  The only  significant  pending
regulatory  approval is the SEC's  declaration of the  effectiveness of the Form
10, and the PepsiCo Board of Directors does not intend to waive this condition.
    

        The  PepsiCo  Board of  Directors  may  amend,  modify  or  abandon  the
Distribution at any time prior to the Distribution Date.

Results of the Distribution

          Subsequent  to the  Distribution,  which will be effective at 11:59:59
p.m.  E.D.T.  on the  Distribution  Date,  TRICON will operate as an independent
restaurant  company,  and PepsiCo will  continue to conduct its  packaged  goods
businesses.

Relationship between PepsiCo and TRICON after the Distribution

        After the  Distribution,  PepsiCo  will have no  ownership  interest  in
TRICON,  and TRICON will be an  independent,  publicly-owned  company.  However,
immediately  after  the  Distribution  Date,  TRICON  shares  will be  owned  by
PepsiCo's  pension  trust on behalf of PepsiCo's  employees.  TRICON and PepsiCo
will  enter  into  certain   agreements,   described   below,   governing  their
relationship  subsequent to the Distribution and providing for the allocation of
tax and certain other liabilities and 

</p><p class="break"> 33


obligations arising from periods prior to and after the Distribution.  Copies of
the forms of such agreements are filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement
of which this  Information  Statement is a part.  The following  summarizes  the
material terms of such agreements,  but is qualified by reference to the text of
such agreements.

Separation Agreement
   
        PepsiCo  and  TRICON  will  enter  into  a  Separation   Agreement  (the
"Separation  Agreement"),  which will provide for,  among other things,  certain
services,  records and personnel which PepsiCo and TRICON will make available to
each other after the  Distribution  Date. To  facilitate an orderly  transition,
PepsiCo  may  continue  to  provide,  for up to 12 months,  certain  services to
TRICON,  with the related costs and expenses  being paid by TRICON.  TRICON will
nonetheless  have to utilize  additional  personnel to perform certain  services
previously  provided  by  PepsiCo,  such as  treasury  management  and  investor
relations.  The  Separation  Agreement  also will provide for the  assumption by
TRICON of  liabilities  relating  to  PepsiCo's  restaurant  businesses  and the
indemnification  of PepsiCo with respect to such liabilities.  At June 14, 1997,
there were  approximately  $2.35  billion of  liabilities  reflected on TRICON's
balance  sheet.   The  Separation   Agreement   provides  that,   prior  to  the
Distribution,  TRICON will pay to PepsiCo  $4.5  billion as repayment of certain
amounts due to PepsiCo from TRICON and a dividend.
    
Tax Separation Agreement

         PepsiCo and TRICON will enter into a Tax Separation Agreement (the "Tax
Separation   Agreement"),   on  behalf  of  themselves   and  their   respective
consolidated  groups,  that reflects each party's  rights and  obligations  with
respect  to  payments  and  refunds of taxes  that are  attributable  to periods
beginning prior to and including the Distribution  Date and taxes resulting from
transactions  effected in connection with the  Distribution.  The Tax Separation
Agreement  also  expresses  each party's  intention  with respect to certain tax
attributes  of  TRICON  after the  Distribution.  The Tax  Separation  Agreement
provides for payments between the two companies for certain tax adjustments made
after the  Distribution  that  cover  pre-Distribution  tax  liabilities.  Other
provisions cover the handling of audits, settlements,  stock options, elections,
accounting  methods  and return  filing in cases  where both  companies  have an
interest in the results of these activities.

   
        Pursuant to the Tax Separation  Agreement,  TRICON will agree to refrain
from engaging in certain  transactions  for two years following the Distribution
Date without the prior written consent of PepsiCo.  Transactions subject to this
restriction  will  include,  among  other  things,  the  liquidation,  merger or
consolidation with another company,  certain issuances and redemptions of TRICON
Common  Stock,  the  granting  of  stock  options,   the  sale,   refranchising,
distribution  or other  disposition  of assets in a manner that would  adversely
affect the tax consequences of the  Distribution or any transaction  effected in
connection with the Distribution, and the discontinuation of certain businesses.
    
</p><p class="break"> 34

Employee Programs Agreement

        PepsiCo and TRICON will enter into an Employee  Programs  Agreement (the
"Employee  Programs  Agreement"),   which  allocates  assets,   liabilities  and
responsibilities  between them with respect to certain employee compensation and
benefit plans and programs and certain other related matters.

Telecommunications, Software and Computing Services Agreement

          PepsiCo and TRICON will also enter into a Telecommunications, Software
and  Computing  Services  Agreement  (the "TS&amp;C  Agreement")  setting  forth the
arrangements between the parties with respect to internal software,  third-party
agreements, telecommunications services and computing services.

Beverage Agreements

   
        KFC,  Pizza  Hut and Taco  Bell  have  each  entered  into a  multi-year
agreement  with  Pepsi-Cola  Company  regarding the sale of Pepsi-Cola  beverage
products at U.S. Company-operated units.
    

Certain Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities

         Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, TRICON will agree to use its best
efforts to release,  terminate or replace,  prior to the Distribution  Date, all
letters of credit,  guarantees and contingent  liabilities relating to PepsiCo's
restaurant  businesses  under which PepsiCo is liable.  Nevertheless,  after the
Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo  may remain  liable on  certain of such  letters of
credit,  guarantees  and  contingent  liabilities  which  were  not  able  to be
released, terminated or replaced prior to the Distribution Date. Pursuant to the
Separation Agreement, from and after the Distribution Date TRICON will pay a fee
to PepsiCo with respect to any such letters of credit, guarantees and contingent
liabilities  until such time as they are  released,  terminated or replaced by a
qualified  letter of  credit  with a maximum  drawing  amount  equal to the full
amount of all remaining obligations and foreseeable claims under such letters of
credit,  guarantees  and  contingent  liabilities.  At all times  TRICON will be
required to indemnify PepsiCo with respect to such letters of credit, guarantees
and contingent liabilities.

Certain  U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution

   
        PepsiCo has received a ruling from the Internal  Revenue  Service to the
effect  that the  Distribution  will  qualify as a tax-free  Distribution  under
Sections  355 and 368 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended  (the
"Code"),  and,  accordingly,  that (i) except as described below with respect to
fractional  shares,  PepsiCo's  shareholders will not recognize income,  gain or
loss upon the receipt of shares of TRICON Common  Stock;  (ii) the aggregate tax
basis of the shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock and TRICON Common Stock  (including
any fractional share interests to which a PepsiCo  shareholder is entitled) held
by a  PepsiCo  shareholder  after the  Distribution  will be the same as the tax
basis  of  the  shares  of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  held  by  such  shareholder
immediately before the Distribution, and will be allocated between the shares of
TRICON Common Stock and PepsiCo  Capital  Stock in proportion to their  relative
fair market values on the  Distribution  Date;  (iii) the holding  period of the
shares of TRICON Common Stock

</p><p class="break"> 35

received by a PepsiCo  shareholder  (including any fractional share interests to
which a PepsiCo  shareholder is entitled) will include the holding period of the
shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock with respect to which the Distribution was made,
provided that the shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock are held as a capital asset by
such  shareholder  on the  Distribution  Date; and (iv) cash received in lieu of
fractional share interests in TRICON Common Stock will give rise to gain or loss
equal to the  difference  between the amount of cash  received and the tax basis
allocable to such fractional share interests.  Such gain or loss will be capital
gain or loss if the shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock are held as a capital asset
on the Distribution Date.
    

          U.S.  Treasury  regulations  require  each  PepsiCo  shareholder  that
receives  shares of TRICON  Common  Stock in the  Distribution  to attach to the
holder's  U.S.  Federal  income  tax  return for the year in which such stock is
received a detailed  statement  setting forth such data as may be appropriate in
order to show the  applicability of Section 355 of the Code to the Distribution.
Within a  reasonable  time after the  Distribution,  PepsiCo  will  provide each
PepsiCo  shareholder  of  record  as of the  Record  Date  with the  information
necessary  to  comply  with  that  requirement,  and  will  provide  information
regarding the allocation of basis described in clause (ii) above.

        The  foregoing  is a summary of the  material  U.S.  Federal  income tax
consequences of the Distribution  under the law in effect as of the date of this
Information Statement.  IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO COVER ALL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
AND MAY  NOT  APPLY  TO  SHAREHOLDERS  WHO  ACQUIRED  THEIR  PEPSICO  SHARES  IN
CONNECTION  WITH A GRANT OF  SHARES AS  COMPENSATION,  WHO ARE NOT  CITIZENS  OR
RESIDENTS  OF THE  UNITED  STATES,  OR WHO  ARE  OTHERWISE  SUBJECT  TO  SPECIAL
TREATMENT UNDER THE CODE. All PepsiCo  shareholders should consult their own tax
advisors  regarding  the  appropriate  income tax  treatment of their receipt of
TRICON Common Stock,  including the  application  of Federal,  state,  local and
foreign tax laws, and the effect of possible  changes in tax law that may affect
the tax consequences described above.

                               Pension Plan Table

         Many of TRICON's salaried employees have been participants in PepsiCo's
Salaried Employees  Retirement Plan and PepsiCo's Pension  Equalization Plan. On
or  prior  to  the  Distribution   Date,  the  Company  and  its   participating
subsidiaries  intend to adopt a TRICON  Salaried  Employees  Retirement Plan and
TRICON  Pension  Equalization  Plan  on  terms  substantially   similar  to  the
comparable  PepsiCo plans.  The annual benefits  payable under these two pension
plans to  employees  with five or more years of  service at age 65 are,  for the
first ten years of credited service,  30% of the employee's highest  consecutive
five-year  average  annual  earnings  plus an  additional  1% of the  employee's
highest  consecutive  five-year average annual earnings for each additional year
of credited  service over ten years,  less .43% of final average earnings not to
exceed Social Security covered compensation  multiplied by years of service (not
to exceed 35 years).

         Under  the  TRICON  plans,  when an  executive  retires  at the  normal
retirement age (65), the approximate  annual  benefits  payable after January 1,
1997 for the following pay  classifications and years of service are expected to
be:

        The pay covered by the pension  plans  referred to above is based on the
salary and bonus shown in the Summary  Compensation Table on page 42 for each of
the named  executive  officers.  The years of credited  service as of January 1,
1997 for the following named  executive  officers are: David C. Novak, 10 years;
Peter A. Bassi, 24 years;  Peter C. Waller, 6 years;  and Sandra S. Wijnberg,  2

Employment Agreement

   
        The Company has entered into an employment  agreement  with Mr.  Pearson
under which he will serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief  Executive  Officer
of TRICON until July 1, 2000.  The  agreement  provides for an annual  salary of
$900,000;  and annual  incentive  compensation  awards to be  determined  by the
TRICON Board of Directors. However, the bonus for 1997 (payable in 1998) will be
$450,000.  TRICON will also pay Mr. Pearson,  by year-end 1997, a one-time bonus
of $850,000.  In addition,  TRICON will make a $1,000,000  retirement payment to
Mr. Pearson at the end of his employment term. As soon as practicable  after the
Distribution  Date,  Mr. Pearson will be granted  options to purchase  1,050,000
shares of TRICON Common Stock. The exercise price of these options will be based
on the closing  price of TRICON Common Stock for the fifth through the twentieth
trading days after the Distribution.  One third of the options will vest on each
of July 1, 1998,  July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000.  They will be exercisable for a
period of ten years from the grant date.
    
                  NEW STOCK-BASED AND INCENTIVE PLANS OF TRICON


TRICON Long-Term Incentive Plan

        Generally.  The TRICON  Long-Term  Incentive Plan (the "TRICON LTIP") is
expected to be approved  prior to the  Distribution  Date by the TRICON Board of
Directors and by PepsiCo as the sole  shareholder of TRICON.  The TRICON LTIP is
expected to provide for the grant of various types of long-term incentive awards
to key employees,  consistent  with the objectives and limitations of the TRICON
LTIP.  These  awards may include  non-qualified  options to  purchase  shares of
TRICON  Common  Stock,   performance  units,   incentive  stock  options,  stock
appreciation  rights and restricted stock grants. The term of the TRICON LTIP is
expected to be ten years.

        Administration.  The TRICON LTIP is expected to vest broad powers in the
Compensation  Committee  (the  "Compensation  Committee")  of TRICON's  Board of
Directors  to  administer  and  interpret  the  TRICON  LTIP.  The  Compensation
Committee's powers are expected to include authority, within the limitations set
forth in the TRICON  LTIP,  to select  the  persons  to be  granted  awards,  to
determine terms and conditions of awards, including but not limited to the type,
size and term of awards,  to determine  the time when awards will be granted and
any conditions for receiving awards, to establish  objectives and conditions for
earning awards,  to determine  whether 

</p><p class="break"> 46

such  conditions  have been met and whether  payment of an award will be made at
the  end of an  award  period,  or at the  time of  exercise,  or  deferred,  to
determine  whether  payment of an award should be reduced or eliminated,  and to
determine whether such awards should be intended to qualify, regardless of their
amount,  as deductible for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.  The TRICON LTIP is
also expected to generally  vest broad powers in the  Compensation  Committee to
amend and terminate the TRICON LTIP.

        Eligibility. Key employees of TRICON and its divisions, subsidiaries and
affiliates  are  expected to be eligible to be granted  awards  under the TRICON
LTIP. The  Compensation  Committee may also grant awards to employees of a joint
venture or other business in which TRICON has a substantial investment,  and may
make awards to  non-executive  employees  who are in a position to contribute to
the success of TRICON.

TRICON Executive Incentive Compensation Plan

        Generally.  TRICON's Executive Incentive  Compensation Plan (the "TRICON
Incentive  Plan") is expected to be approved prior to the  Distribution  Date by
the TRICON Board of Directors and by PepsiCo as the sole  shareholder of TRICON.
The TRICON  Incentive Plan is expected to provide for officers of TRICON and its
divisions and subsidiaries to be granted annual cash incentive awards consistent
with the objectives and  limitations of the TRICON  Incentive  Plan. The term of
the TRICON Incentive Plan is expected to be ten years.

        Administration.  The TRICON  Incentive  Plan is  expected  to vest broad
powers in the  Compensation  Committee to  administer  and  interpret the TRICON
Incentive  Plan.  The  Compensation  Committee's  powers are expected to include
authority,  within the  limitations  set forth in the TRICON  Incentive Plan, to
select the persons to be granted awards,  to determine the time when awards will
be granted,  to determine and certify  whether  objectives  and  conditions  for
earning awards have been met, to determine  whether  payment of an award will be
made at the end of an award  period or  deferred,  and to  determine  whether an
award or  payment  of an award  should be  reduced  or  eliminated.  The  TRICON
Incentive  Plan  is  also  expected  to  generally  vest  broad  powers  in  the
Compensation Committee to amend and terminate the TRICON Incentive Plan.

        Eligibility. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee,  executive
officers of TRICON are expected to be granted, and other officers of TRICON, its
divisions and  subsidiaries  may be granted,  annual  incentive awards under the
TRICON Incentive Plan.

Successor Plans

        On or prior to the Distribution Date, the Company intends to adopt plans
with terms substantially similar to the PepsiCo Stock Option Incentive Plan (the
"PepsiCo  SOIP")  and  the  PepsiCo   SharePower  Stock  Option  Plan  ("PepsiCo
SharePower")  for the purpose of  continuing  TRICON  stock  options  which were
converted  from options  granted under such PepsiCo  plans.  See "PepsiCo  Stock
Option and Performance Share Conversion." It has not yet been determined whether
any new  grants  will be made  under  these  plans.  TRICON  stock  options  and
performance  share units  ("PSUs") which were converted from options or PSUs, as

PepsiCo  Long-Term  Incentive Plan  ("PepsiCo  LTIP") will be considered to have
been awarded under the TRICON LTIP described above.


             PEPSICO STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE SHARE CONVERSION

        Effective on the Distribution  Date,  holders of outstanding  options to
purchase  PepsiCo  Capital Stock and holders of unvested  PepsiCo PSUs will have
their  interests  adjusted as described  below.  The  Compensation  Committee of
PepsiCo's Board of Directors has approved  formulas to adjust the exercise price
and award size of  PepsiCo  stock  options  and PSUs  pursuant  to the terms and
provisions of each such grant and the relevant plan.  TRICON  employees who hold
PepsiCo  awards will receive  either an award of TRICON stock options or PSUs or
an adjusted PepsiCo award, in accordance with the formulas  described below. The
adjustment  formulas  are  intended  to  maintain  the value of the  outstanding
PepsiCo stock options at the time of adjustment.

   
        Stock Options. Employees of TRICON who received PepsiCo stock options in
connection  with the 1996 grants and any 1997 grants  under the PepsiCo LTIP and
the PepsiCo  SOIP,  and  employees of TRICON who received  PepsiCo stock options
under  PepsiCo  SharePower  which  have  not  become  exercisable  prior  to the
Distribution Date, shall have such PepsiCo stock options entirely converted into
TRICON stock options.  For these converted  options,  the exercise price of each
such TRICON stock option  shall equal the  exercise  price of the  corresponding
PepsiCo  stock option  prior to the  Distribution,  multiplied  by a factor (the
"TRICON Stock  Conversion  Ratio")  where the numerator is the composite  volume
weighted  average price of the TRICON Common Stock for the trading days during a
pricing  period to be  determined  at a future date (the "Per Share TRICON Stock
Price") and the denominator is the composite  volume  weighted  average price of
PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  trading  with  TRICON for the  trading  days during the
pricing period (the "Per Share  Pre-Split  PepsiCo Stock Price").  The number of
shares of TRICON  Common  Stock  subject to each such TRICON  stock option shall
equal the number of shares  subject to the  corresponding  PepsiCo  stock option
prior to the  Distribution  divided by the TRICON Stock  Conversion  Ratio.  All
other terms of such TRICON stock  options  shall be the same as the terms of the
PepsiCo stock options from which they were converted.
    

        Employees of TRICON who received  PepsiCo  stock  options in  connection
with grants made prior to 1996 under the PepsiCo LTIP and the PepsiCo SOIP,  and
employees of TRICON who received PepsiCo stock options under PepsiCo  SharePower
which have become  exercisable prior to the Distribution Date, shall retain such
options to purchase PepsiCo Capital Stock, subject to the following  adjustments
to the exercise price and number of shares subject to each such option (each, an
"Adjusted  PepsiCo Stock Option").  The exercise price of each Adjusted  PepsiCo
Stock  Option  shall be  determined  by  multiplying  the PepsiCo  stock  option
exercise  price  prior to the  Distribution  by a  factor  (the  "PepsiCo  Stock
Conversion  Ratio") where the numerator is the composite volume weighted average
price of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  trading  without  TRICON for the trading  days
during the pricing period (the "Per Share  Post-Split  PepsiCo Stock Price") and
the  denominator is the Per Share Pre-Split  PepsiCo Stock Price.  The number of
shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock  subject to each Adjusted  PepsiCo Stock Option
shall equal the number of shares  subject to such PepsiCo  stock option prior to
the Distribution  divided by the PepsiCo Stock Conversion Ratio. All other 

</p><p class="break"> 48

terms of the Adjusted  PepsiCo  Stock  Options shall be the same as the terms of
the pre-adjustment PepsiCo stock options.

        Employees of PepsiCo who will  continue to be employed by PepsiCo  after
the  Distribution  Date and hold any PepsiCo stock  options,  and holders of any
PepsiCo stock options who retire or have retired from PepsiCo on or prior to the
Distribution Date,  regardless of whether such holder has retired from PepsiCo's
packaged  goods or restaurant  businesses and regardless of whether such options
were granted under the PepsiCo LTIP,  the PepsiCo  SOIP,  PepsiCo  SharePower or
otherwise,  shall retain such options to purchase PepsiCo Capital Stock, subject
to the  adjustments  to the exercise  price and number of shares subject to each
such  option  described  in the  previous  paragraph.  All  other  terms of such
Adjusted  PepsiCo  Stock  Options  shall  be  the  same  as  the  terms  of  the
pre-adjustment PepsiCo stock options.

        Performance  Share Units.  Performance  share units awarded in 1994 will
remain  unchanged for employees of TRICON and post-split  PepsiCo.  These awards
will continue to earn out against the pre-established  earnings per share target
("EPS") and are expected to be paid out on schedule in 1998. EPS results will be
measured on a consolidated basis (including the restaurant  businesses)  through
the end of 1997,  provided that forecasted  restaurant earnings will be used for
the period between the Distribution Date and year-end in the EPS calculation.

        Performance  share  units  awarded  in 1996 will have  their  target EPS
adjusted, but vesting, the measurement period and the payout date of such awards
will remain unchanged for employees of TRICON and post-split PepsiCo. For TRICON
employees,   the  TRICON  Board  of  Directors  is  expected  to  determine  the
appropriate  four year  cumulative  EPS target for such awards based on TRICON's
business plans. For employees of post-split  PepsiCo,  the current four year EPS
target will be adjusted to reflect the  exclusion of the  restaurant  businesses
while maintaining the original annual growth rate amounts.

                       DESCRIPTION OF TRICON CAPITAL STOCK

   
        Under  TRICON's   Restated   Articles  of  Incorporation   (the  "TRICON
Articles"), which have been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of
which this Information Statement forms a part, TRICON's authorized Capital Stock
consists of 1,000,000,000 shares,  without par value, of which 750,000,000 shall
be Common Stock and 250,000,000  shall be preferred stock  ("Preferred  Stock").
Based on 1.53 billion shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock outstanding as of July 11,
1997,  estimates of the number of shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock which will be
(i) repurchased by PepsiCo prior to the  Distribution  Date and (ii) issued upon
the exercise of options prior to the Distribution Date, and a distribution ratio
of one share of TRICON  Common  Stock for every ten  shares of  PepsiCo  Capital
Stock,  it is expected that  approximately  152 million  shares of TRICON Common
Stock will be  distributed  to holders of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock.  No Preferred
Stock  will be  distributed  to  PepsiCo  shareholders  in  connection  with the
Distribution.
    
</p><p class="break"> 49

TRICON Common Stock

        The holders of TRICON Common Stock will be entitled to one vote for each
share on all  matters  voted  on by  shareholders,  including  the  election  of
directors.  Except as provided  with  respect to any series of  Preferred  Stock
authorized  by TRICON's  Board of  Directors,  the  exclusive  voting power with
respect  to all  matters to be voted on by  shareholders  shall be vested in the
holders of Common  Stock.  The TRICON  Articles do not  provide  for  cumulative
voting in the election of directors.  The holders of TRICON Common Stock will be
entitled to such  dividends  as may be declared  from time to time by the TRICON
Board from funds available  therefor,  and upon  liquidation will be entitled to
receive,  pro rata, all the net assets of TRICON  available for  distribution to
such holders.  All of the shares of TRICON Common Stock  distributed  by PepsiCo
will be fully paid and  nonassessable.  The holders of TRICON  Common Stock will
have no preemptive right to subscribe for or purchase any securities of any kind
or class of TRICON.

TRICON Preferred Stock

        Under  the  TRICON  Articles,   the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  is
empowered, subject to limitations prescribed by North Carolina law, to amend the
TRICON  Articles to authorize  the issuance of Preferred  Stock.  The  Preferred
Stock may be divided into two or more series, with such preferences, limitations
and relative rights as the Board may determine.  However, no holder of Preferred
Stock shall be authorized or entitled to receive upon an involuntary liquidation
of the Company an amount in excess of $100 per share of Preferred Stock.

Dividends

   
        The  payment  and level of cash  dividends,  if any,  declared by TRICON
after the  Distribution  will be subject to the  discretion of the TRICON Board.
Dividend  decisions  will be based on a number of  factors,  including  TRICON's
operating  results and financial  requirements on a stand-alone basis as well as
credit agreement and legal restrictions relating thereto.
    

Transfer Agent and Registrar

   
        The Transfer  Agent and  Registrar  for the TRICON  Common Stock will be
BankBoston,N.A., P.O. Box 9155, Boston, MA 02205-9155, (800) 226-0083.
    

Listing and Trading of TRICON Common Stock

        Prior to the date  hereof,  there has not been any  established  trading
market for TRICON Common Stock.  Application  is expected to be made to list the
TRICON  Common  Stock  on the NYSE  under  the  symbol  "YUM."  It is  presently
anticipated  that the TRICON  Common  Stock will be approved  for listing on the
NYSE prior to the  Distribution  Date,  and trading is expected to commence on a
"when issued" basis prior to the Record Date. The term "when issued" indicates a
conditional  transaction  in a security  authorized  for issuance but not as yet
actually  issued.  All "when issued"  transactions  are on an "if" basis,  to be
settled if and when the actual  security is issued and the NYSE directs that the
transactions are to be settled.

</p><p class="break"> 50

   
        There can be no  assurance  as to the prices at which the TRICON  Common
Stock will trade before,  on or after the  Distribution  Date.  Until the TRICON
Common Stock is fully  distributed and an orderly trading market develops in the
TRICON  Common  Stock,  the  price at which  such  stock  trades  may  fluctuate
significantly and may be lower or higher than the respective price that would be
expected for a fully distributed issue.  Prices for the TRICON Common Stock will
be  determined  in the  marketplace  and  may be  influenced  by  many  factors,
including  (i) the depth and  liquidity of the market for TRICON  Common  Stock,
(ii) developments  affecting  TRICON's  business,  (iii) investor  perception of
TRICON, and (iv) general economic and market conditions.  As of August 15, 1997,
there were 222,345 record holders of PepsiCo Capital Stock,  which  approximates
the number of prospective record holders of TRICON Common Stock. 
    


        Shares of TRICON Common Stock  distributed in the  Distribution  will be
freely transferable, except for securities received by persons who may be deemed
to be affiliates of TRICON  ("Affiliates")  under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act").  Affiliates would generally include  individuals
or entities that control,  are  controlled  by, or are under common control with
TRICON and will include  certain  officers and Directors of TRICON.  Persons who
are Affiliates of TRICON will be permitted to sell their shares of TRICON Common
Stock only pursuant to an effective  registration statement under the Securities
Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.


                     NORTH CAROLINA LAW - SHARE ACQUISITIONS

        North  Carolina  law  includes  two  provisions  relating  to changes in
control of a public company as a result of share acquisitions.  The first is The
North  Carolina  Control Share  Acquisition  Act,  which requires an acquiror to
obtain the favorable vote of a company's other shareholders before it is allowed
to vote shares acquired in excess of certain statutory percentages. As permitted
by the Act, the TRICON Articles provide that this Act shall not be applicable to
TRICON.  The second is The North  Carolina  Shareholder  Protection  Act,  which
establishes  minimum safeguards for a company's public shareholders in the event
another  entity  first  acquires  more than 20% of the stock and then  wishes to
accomplish a second-step  combination  of the two  businesses.  Such  safeguards
relate to the minimum value to be paid to the company's  remaining  shareholders
in  any  such  business   combination;   preservation   of  board  of  directors
representation  for  the  publicly-owned   shares  and  of  the  dividend  rate;
limitations on certain intercorporate  transactions prior to the consummation of
such  business  combination;  and  requirements  as to  disclosure  to remaining
shareholders in connection with any such proposed business  combination.  Unless
these minimum  safeguards  are observed,  any such  business  combination  would
require the  affirmative  vote of the  holders of 95% of the voting  shares of a
corporation.

                         INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS

        A provision of the TRICON  Articles (the  "Provision")  provides that to
the full  extent  from  time to time  permitted  by law,  no  Director  shall be
personally liable in any action for monetary damages for breach of any duty as a
Director,  whether  such  action is brought by or in the right of the Company or
otherwise.  Neither the amendment nor repeal of the  Provision,  nor adoption of
any provision of the TRICON Articles which is  

</p><p class="break"> 51


inconsistent  with the  Provision,  shall  eliminate  or reduce  the  protection
afforded by the  Provision  with  respect to any matter which  occurred,  or any
cause of action,  suit or claim which,  but for the Provision would have accrued
or arisen, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

        While the TRICON Articles provide  Directors with protection from awards
for monetary  damages for breaches of their duty of care,  they do not eliminate
such  duty.  Accordingly,  the  TRICON  Articles  will  have  no  effect  on the
availability of equitable remedies such as an injunction or recission based on a
Director's breach of his or her duty of care.

     The TRICON  Articles  provide that the Company shall, to the fullest extent
from time to time permitted by law, indemnify its Directors and officers against
all liabilities and expenses in any suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or  investigative,  and whether or not brought by or on behalf of
the Company,  including  all appeals  therefrom,  arising out of their status as
such  or  their  activities  in any  of the  foregoing  capacities,  unless  the
activities  of the  person to be  indemnified  were at the time  taken  known or
believed  by him to be  clearly  in  conflict  with  the best  interests  of the
Company.  The Company shall likewise and to the same extent indemnify any person
who, at the request of the  Company,  is or was serving as a Director,  officer,
partner,  trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or other  enterprise,  or as a  trustee  or
administrator under any employee benefit plan. The right to be indemnified shall
include,  without  limitation,  the right of a  Director  or  officer to be paid
expenses in advance of the final  disposition of any proceeding  upon receipt of
an  undertaking  to repay such amount  unless it shall  ultimately be determined
that  he  or  she  is  entitled  to  be   indemnified.   A  person  entitled  to
indemnification  shall also be paid  reasonable  costs,  expenses and attorneys'
fees  (including  expenses) in connection  with the enforcement of rights to the
indemnification  granted.  The foregoing rights of indemnification  shall not be
exclusive  of any other  rights to which those  seeking  indemnification  may be
entitled  and shall  not be  limited  by the  provisions  of the North  Carolina
Business  Corporation Act or any successor  statute.  The Board of Directors may
take such action as it deems  necessary or desirable to carry out the  foregoing
indemnification  provisions,  including adopting  procedures for determining and
enforcing the rights guaranteed thereby, and the Board of Directors is expressly
empowered to adopt, approve and amend from time to time such Bylaws, resolutions
or  contracts  implementing  such  provisions  or such  further  indemnification
arrangement  as may be permitted by law.  Neither the amendment or repeal of the
foregoing indemnification  provisions,  nor the adoption of any provision of the
TRICON  Articles  inconsistent  with the foregoing  indemnification  provisions,
shall  eliminate  or  reduce  any  rights  to  indemnification  afforded  by the
foregoing indemnification  provisions to any person with respect to their status
or any activities in their official  capacities prior to such amendment,  repeal
or adoption.
                  1998 ANNUAL MEETING AND SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

        TRICON's first annual  shareholders  meeting after the  Distribution  is
expected to be held on May 13, 1998. If a shareholder  wishes to have a proposal
considered  at the 1998  meeting and  included in the Proxy  Statement  for that
meeting,  the  proposal  must be  received  by  TRICON in  writing  on or before
November 30, 1997.

             MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

             Management's Discussion and Analysis
    for Fiscal Years Ended December 28 1996, December 30, 1995
                      and December 31, 1994
   
     For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis, 
TRICON includes the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut and
Taco Bell (its core businesses)and the non-core U.S. businesses 
held for disposal: CPK, Chevys, D'Angelo, ESM and HNN.

     The following Management's Discussion and Analysis
should be read in conjunction with the audited Combined
Financial Statements on pages F-2 - F-24 and the Cautionary
Statements on page 69. The audited Combined Financial
Statements included herein may not necessarily be indicative
of the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of TRICON in the future or had it operated as a
separate, independent company during the periods presented.
The audited Combined Financial Statements included herein do
not reflect any changes that may occur in the financing and
operations of TRICON as a result of the Distribution.

     This Management's Discussion and Analysis is presented in
five sections.  The first section discusses TRICON's
ownership strategy and portfolio management (pages 52-53).  The
second section analyzes the combined results of operations
and provides a perspective on operations outside of the
United States (pages 53-59).  The third and fourth sections
address TRICON's combined cash flows (pages 59-61) and
financial condition (page 61), respectively.  The final
section summarizes TRICON's use of derivatives (page 62).

Ownership Strategy and Portfolio Management

     TRICON continues to execute the initiatives started two
years ago to reduce its percentage ownership of total system
units by selling Company-operated restaurants to 

</p><p class="break"> 53

existing and new franchisees and closing underperforming units.  
Although these initiatives reduce reported revenues, the 
refranchising initiative is intended to improve returns by
eliminating the capital investment in units while generating 
franchise fees.  In addition, margins and cash flows benefit from
the one-time impact of refranchising gains and the ongoing impact 
of closing underperforming Company-operated units.  As a result of
these initiatives, coupled with net new points of
distribution by TRICON's franchisees and licensees, TRICON's
overall ownership percentage (including joint venture units)
of its core businesses' total system units declined by 2 percentage
points to 48% at year-end 1995 and 4 percentage points to 44% at 
year-end 1996, both driven by declines in the U.S. TRICON
refranchised 264 and 640 Company-operated units in 1995
and 1996, respectively.  Total system units grew 6% and 4% in
1995 and 1996, respectively, driven by net new points of
distribution by TRICON's franchisees and licensees.  At year-
end 1995 and 1996 TRICON had 293 and 296 Company-operated
non-core U.S. restaurants, respectively.
    
Results of Operations

     The table in Note 3 on page F-11 summarizes significant
items impacting comparability.

   
     Revenues declined $18 million in 1996.  Company-
operated restaurants revenues decreased $75 million or 1%.
The decrease was driven by volume declines, partially due to
lapping the strong volume increases in the second quarter of
1995 because of the successful introduction of Stuffed Crust
Pizza in the U.S., and the unfavorable impact of fewer net
Company-operated units.  These declines were partially
offset by higher effective net pricing and the consolidation
of CPK at the end of the second quarter of 1996 (see Note 16 
on page F-20).  The $57 million or 13% increase in franchise 
and license fees primarily reflected new franchise and license
units and the continuing franchise fees from refranchised 
restaurants.
    

     In 1996, same store sales for Company-operated units
increased 6% at KFC U.S. due primarily to the impact of new
products such as Tender Roast Chicken, Colonel's Crispy
Strips and Chunky Chicken Pot Pies.  Same store sales for
Company-operated units decreased 4% and 2% at Pizza Hut U.S.
and Taco Bell U.S., respectively, reflecting fewer customer
transaction counts.

   
     Revenues increased $685 million or 7% in 1995.  The
fifty-third week in 1994 (see Note 3 on page F-11) reduced
the 1995 revenue growth rate by approximately 2 percentage 
points.Company-operated restaurants revenues grew $643 million
or 7%.  The growth reflected net additional Company-operated
units and higher effective net pricing, partially offset by
a decline in volume.  Franchise and license fees increased
$42 million or 11%, primarily driven by the net new points
of distribution by TRICON's franchisees and licensees.
    

     In 1995, same store sales for Company-operated units
increased 4% and 7% at Pizza Hut U.S. and KFC U.S.,
respectively, driven by new product offerings.  Same store
sales for Company-operated units declined 4% at Taco Bell
U.S. due to fewer customer transaction counts. Same store
sales growth has been adjusted to exclude the impact of the
fifty-third week in 1994 (see Note 3 on page F-11).

__________________________________________________________________________


   
     In 1996, Company-operated restaurant margins declined
 .4 percentage points.  The decline primarily reflected an increase 
in operating costs as a percent of revenues due to lower
revenues caused by decreased customer transaction counts in
Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. (i.e., "deleveraging").  The
margin decline was moderated by the fact that higher
effective net pricing exceeded increases in the costs of
labor, food (led by cheese) and occupancy and other
operating expenses.  The increased labor costs reflected
increases in wage rates and benefits as well as increased
staffing due to TRICON's customer service improvement
initiatives.  Increased occupancy and other operating
expenses included higher refurbishment expenses at Pizza Hut
U.S.

     Company-operated restaurant margins declined .1 percentage
point in 1995.  The deleveraging effect of reduced revenues at
Taco Bell U.S. due to decreased customer transaction counts
coupled with increased occupancy and other operating
expenses, were substantially offset by reduced food costs
(led by beef), labor efficiencies resulting from reduced
restaurant management staffing and higher effective net pricing.

     General, administrative and other expenses ("G&amp;A")
comprises general and administrative expenses, other income
and expense and equity income or loss from investments in
unconsolidated affiliates. The $75 million or 9% growth in
G&amp;A in 1996 reflected increased spending, led by multiple
U.S. initiatives to improve customer service and to support
international growth.  Customer service initiatives included
expanding the number and training of personnel supervising
the restaurant managers, as well as project spending against
market-related programs.  These increased expenses were
offset by equity income in 1996 compared to losses in 1995,
due in part to the absence of CPK's losses as a result of
its consolidation in 1996 (see Note 16 on page F-20).  In
1995, G&amp;A grew $42 million or 5% primarily reflecting a $17
million charge in 1995 to move Pizza Hut's headquarters from
Wichita to Dallas, spending to support U.S. field
operations and international development.  Included in G&amp;A
is an allocated amount reflecting TRICON's share of overhead
costs related to PepsiCo's shared administrative expenses of
$53 million, $52 million and $50 million in 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively.  The amounts allocated to TRICON were
based on the ratio of TRICON's revenues to PepsiCo's
revenues.  They are not necessarily indicative of the
expenses that TRICON would have incurred for these services
had it been a separate, independent company.

for restaurants to be used in the business under SFAS 121.
TRICON early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the
fourth quarter of 1995.  The initial, noncash charge of $457
million in 1995, $120 million of which related to the non-
core U.S. businesses, resulted from TRICON evaluating and
measuring impairment of restaurants to be used in the
business at the individual restaurant level.  Previously,
impairment was evaluated and measured if a restaurant
concept was incurring operating losses and was expected to
incur operating losses in the future.  Because of the strong
operating profit history or prospects for each concept, no
impairment evaluation had been required in 1994.  The
recurring SFAS 121 impairment charge in 1996 resulted from
the semi-annual impairment evaluations of each restaurant to
be used in the business that either initially met TRICON's
"two-year history of operating losses" impairment indicator
or was previously evaluated for impairment and, due to
changes in circumstances, a current forecast of future cash
flows would be expected to be significantly lower than the
forecast used in the prior evaluation.

     Unusual disposal charges of $246 million ($189 million
after-tax) in 1996 were associated with a fourth quarter
decision to dispose of TRICON's remaining non-core U.S.
businesses, CPK, Chevys, D'Angelo and ESM, and a first
quarter decision to dispose of the operating assets of HNN.
These charges were on top of the $120 million of impairment
charges incurred for these businesses  in 1995.

     The additional impairment charges recognized in 1996
reflect both a different assessment of the future prospects
of the businesses compared to 1995 and the different
requirements under SFAS 121 for determining impairment for
assets to be sold (1996 basis) compared to assets to be held
and used in the business (1995 basis). For an asset to be
disposed of, SFAS 121 requires the asset be recorded at the
lower of its carrying amount or fair market value, i.e., the
amount a third party would be willing to pay, less costs to
sell.  For an asset to be held and used, an asset can not be
impaired when the related estimated nominal, undiscounted
future cash flows, before interest and income taxes, are
equal to or greater than the carrying amount of the asset.
Thus, an asset to be held and used cannot be impaired even
though its estimated future cash flows may not provide a
normal return on TRICON's investment.

     Reported operating profit increased $120 million in
1996.  Ongoing operating profit, which was adjusted to
exclude the unusual disposal charges in 1996 and the initial
impact of adopting SFAS 121 in 1995 (see Note 3 on page F-
11), decreased $91 million or 13%.  The decline reflected
the increased G&amp;A expenses and reduced profit from Company-
operated restaurants, partially offset by increased profit
from franchise and license fees.

     Reported operating profit decreased $330 million in
1995.  Ongoing operating profit, which was adjusted to
exclude the initial impact of adopting SFAS 121 in 1995 (see
Note 3 on page F-11), grew $127 million or 22%.  The fifty-
third week in 1994 (see Note 3 on page F-11) reduced the
ongoing operating profit growth rate by approximately 5
percentage points.  The increase was due to net refranchising 
gains in 1995, compared to store closure costs in 1994, higher
profits from Company-operated restaurants and increased
franchise and license fees.  These improvements were
partially offset by increased G&amp;A expenses.

     TRICON's operations have been financed through its
operating cash flows, refranchising of restaurants and
investments by and advances from PepsiCo.  TRICON's interest
expense includes an allocation of PepsiCo's interest expense
(PepsiCo's weighted average interest rate applied to the
average balance of investments by and advances from PepsiCo
to TRICON) and interest expense on its external debt.
TRICON's external debt is primarily limited to capital lease
obligations associated with real estate and, to a much
lesser extent, assumed debt of acquired businesses and
international third-party debt.  TRICON is expected to have
a capital structure different from the capital structure in
the Combined Financial Statements (see Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Balance Sheet on page F-32) and accordingly,
interest expense is not necessarily indicative of the
interest expense that TRICON would have incurred as a
separate, independent company or will incur in future
periods.

     Interest expense, net declined 15% in 1996 primarily
reflecting a lower average balance of net investments by and
advances from PepsiCo, coupled with PepsiCo having a lower
weighted average interest rate.  Interest expense, net in
1995 increased 4%, reflecting an increase in PepsiCo's
weighted average interest rate, coupled with a higher
average balance of investments by and advances from PepsiCo.

     The 1996, 1995 and 1994 reported effective tax rates
were 173.6%, (28.2%) and 50.6%, respectively.  The following
reconciles the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to TRICON's
ongoing effective rate:

Ongoing effective tax rate           57.2%    45.8%    50.6%

   
     The 1996 ongoing effective tax rate increased 11.4 percentage
points to 57.2% while the 1995 ongoing effective tax rate
declined 4.8 percentage points to 45.8%.  The effective tax rate
attributable to foreign operations varied from year-to-year
but in each year was higher than the U.S. Federal statutory 
tax rate.  This was primarily due to foreign tax rate
differentials, including foreign withholding tax paid
without benefit of the related foreign tax credit for U.S.
income tax purposes, and losses of foreign operations for
which no tax benefit could be currently recognized.

     The increase in the 1996 ongoing effective tax rate
related to an increase in tax effects attributable to
foreign operations, due in part to adjustments related to
prior tax years, and the establishment of a valuation
allowance due to a change in judgment as to the expected
realization of certain foreign deferred tax assets resulting
from a larger than expected net operating loss during 1996
and forecasted continuing operating losses for the next
several years in a foreign jurisdiction.
    

     The decrease in the 1995 ongoing effective tax rate
principally reflected a reduction in tax effects
attributable to foreign operations and reduced state income
taxes.

     Income tax expense was calculated as if TRICON filed
separate income tax returns.  As PepsiCo manages its tax
position on a consolidated basis, which takes into 

</p><p class="break"> 58


account the results of all of its businesses, TRICON's effective 
tax rate in the future could vary from its historical effective
tax rates.  TRICON's future effective tax rate will largely
depend on its structure and tax strategies as a separate,
independent company.

     In 1996, TRICON's international business represented
about 20% of its revenues and its ongoing operating profits.
As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income
statements of TRICON's international operations into U.S.
dollars could affect year-over-year comparability of
operating results.  To the extent that translation effects
are material, they are discussed herein.
    

International Operations Review

1996 vs. 1995

     Revenues increased $221 million driven by the favorable
impact of net additional Company-operated units, higher
effective net pricing and increased volumes.

</p><p class="break"> 59


     Reported operating profit increased $170 million.
Ongoing operating profit increased $33 million reflecting
increased franchise and license fees due to new unit
activity, net additional Company-operated units, increased
volumes and profits from net facility actions compared to
losses in 1995 (see below).  These benefits were partially
offset by increased administrative costs for systems
initiatives and standardization of operational processes to
support growth.

1995 vs. 1994

   
    Revenues increased $293 million or 16%.
The fifty-third week in 1994 (see Note 3 on page F-11)
reduced the 1995 revenue growth rate by approximately 2 
percentage points.  The revenue increase primarily reflected 
additional Company-operated units.

    Reported operating profit decreased $105 million.
Ongoing operating profit increased $32 million or 41%.  The
fifty-third week in 1994 (see Note 3 on page F-11) reduced
the ongoing operating profit growth rate by approximately 7
percentage points. The increased ongoing operating profit 
reflected additional Company-operated units, increased franchise 
and license fees primarily from net new units and a net
favorable currency translation impact. These gains were
partially offset by increased administrative expenses and $8
million of net facility losses in 1995.  A reduction in
volume was substantially offset by higher prices, which
exceeded increased costs.

Combined Cash Flows

     TRICON's capital investments and acquisitions have been
financed by cash flow from operations, refranchising of
restaurants, or investments by and advances from PepsiCo.
Under PepsiCo's centralized cash management system, PepsiCo
deposits to TRICON's bank accounts sufficient cash to meet
TRICON's daily obligations and withdraws excess funds from
those accounts.  These transactions are included in
investments by and advances from PepsiCo in the Combined
Balance Sheet.

     The debt levels prior to the Distribution are not
indicative of the debt levels of TRICON as a separate,
independent entity. As an independent company, TRICON
expects to obtain initial debt funding of approximately $4.5 
billion through a $2 billion senior, unsecured five-year term 
loan facility and $2.5 billion under a senior, unsecured five-
year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.  A portion of
the latter facility will be available in the form of letters
of credit.  Interest rates are expected to be based on LIBOR.  
The facilities are expected to have a quarterly facility fee as well
as a semi-annual administrative fee.  TRICON expects to use 
substantially all of the initial debt proceeds to settle certain 
amounts due to PepsiCo from TRICON and to declare and 

</p><p class="break"> 60


pay a dividend to PepsiCo just prior to the Distribution.  
Management believes that cash flows from its refranchising 
initiatives and from its operating activities in excess of capital 
spending will be sufficient to fund its debt payments and future 
growth.
    

     Combined cash flow activity in 1996 reflected cash
flows from operating activities of $713 million which,
coupled with cash inflows from refranchising of restaurants
of $355 million, funded capital spending of $620 million and
reduced investments by and advances from PepsiCo by $285
million and third-party debt by $137 million.

     Net cash provided by operating activities decreased
$100 million or 12% to $713 million in 1996.  The decrease
was due to reduced income before noncash charges and credits
of $76 million and lower working capital cash inflows of $24
million.  The decline in working capital cash inflows was
primarily due to an unfavorable swing in income taxes
payable partially offset by faster growth in accounts
payable and other current liabilities and a favorable swing
in inventories.  The change in accounts payable and other
current liabilities was primarily due to timing of payments.

     Net cash provided by operating activities in 1995
declined $81 million or 9% versus 1994 to $813 million.  The
decline primarily reflected lower working capital cash
inflows in 1995 of $113 million partially offset by
increased income before noncash charges and credits of $32
million.  The decline in working capital cash inflows was
primarily due to a slower rate of growth in accounts payable
and other current liabilities in 1995 partially offset by a
favorable swing in income taxes payable.  The change in
accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily
reflected timing of payments and a reduced level of
purchases.

     Net cash used for investing activities decreased $348
million or 58% to $249 million in 1996 and $667 million or
53% to $597 million in 1995.  The 1996 decline was
principally due to increased proceeds from refranchising of
restaurants, coupled with reduced capital spending and the
absence of acquisitions.  The 1995 decline was primarily due
to reduced capital spending and acquisitions, proceeds from
1995 refranchisings and reduced loans to unconsolidated
affiliates, which are classified in other, net.

     The decreased capital spending of $81 million in 1996
and $337 million in 1995 primarily reflected a slow down of
new unit development by TRICON as part of its initiative to
reduce its percentage ownership of total system units.
Capital spending outside of the U.S. represented 26% of
total capital spending in 1996 and 1995 and 32% in 1994.

     Net cash used for financing activities almost doubled
in 1996 to $422 million primarily reflecting debt payments
in 1996 compared to proceeds in 1995 and a greater decline
in investments by and advances from PepsiCo.  Net cash used
for financing activities of $218 million in 1995 compared to
a cash inflow of $388 million in 1994.  This change was
primarily due to a swing in investments by and advances from
PepsiCo.

     Free cash flow is the key internal measure used to
evaluate cash flow that investors may want to consider as an
indication of cash available for debt repayment and to fund
additional investments.  Free cash flow is not a measure
defined by generally accepted accounting principles.  This
measure is provided as a supplement, and not as an
alternative to cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles.

     In 1996, free cash flow increased $182 million or 65%
to $464 million.  The increase reflected the higher proceeds
from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital
spending, partially offset by reduced cash flow from
operating activities.  In 1995, the favorable free cash flow
swing of $539 million was due primarily to lower capital
spending, 1995 refranchising of restaurants and the reduced
loans to unconsolidated affiliates, which are classified in
other, net.  These cash inflows were partially offset by
reduced cash flow from operating activities.

Combined Financial Condition


     Assets at year-end 1996 decreased $388 million or 6% to
$6.5 billion.  The decline reflected the impact of the
unusual disposal charges of $246 million (see Note 3 on page
F-11).  The increase in prepaid expenses, deferred income
taxes and other current assets principally reflected a
reclassification of the reduced carrying amount (which
reflects estimated fair market value) of the non-core U.S.
restaurant assets which are held for disposal and a related
increase in current deferred income tax assets.

     TRICON's negative operating working capital position,
which reflects the cash sales nature of TRICON's operations,
effectively provides additional capital for investment.
Operating working capital, which excludes short-term
investments and short-term borrowings, was a negative $445
million and negative $831 million at year-end 1996 and 1995,
respectively.  The $386 million decrease in negative working
capital in 1996 primarily reflected the reclassification of
the non-core U.S. restaurant assets held for disposal to
other current assets and the increase in current deferred
income taxes.

   
     See the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet on
page F-32, which gives effect to TRICON's anticipated
capital structure.

Derivative Instruments

     TRICON's policy prohibits the use of derivative
instruments for trading purposes and TRICON has procedures
in place to monitor and control their use.

     TRICON's use of derivative instruments is currently
limited to commodity futures contracts traded on national
exchanges, which are entered into with the objective of
reducing food costs.  While such hedging activity has
historically been limited, hedging activity could increase
in the future if TRICON believes it would result in lower
total costs.  Open contracts and deferred gains and losses
at year-end 1996 and 1995, as well as gains and losses
recognized as part of cost of sales in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
were not significant.

   
             Management's Discussion and Analysis
 for the 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 14, 1997 and June 15, 1996


     The following Management's Discussion and Analysis
should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed
Combined Financial Statements on pages F-25 - F-29 and the
Cautionary Statements on page 69.  For purposes of this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, TRICON includes the
worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, its
core businesses.  In addition, the U.S. information includes
TRICON's non-core businesses consisting of Chevys, ESM, and
HNN through their respective dates of disposal, and CPK and
D'Angelo, which are held for disposal.

Ownership Initiatives

     As a result of TRICON's initiative to refranchise units
and close underperforming units, coupled with net new points
of distribution by TRICON's franchisees and licensees,
TRICON's overall ownership percentage (including joint
venture units) of its core businesses' total system units
since year-end 1996 declined 2% to 42% at June 14, 1997,
driven by declines in the U.S.  TRICON refranchised 
261 and 355 Company-operated units in the quarter and year-to-date,
respectively.  Total system units declined less than half a
percentage point from the end of 1996.  At June 14, 1997 and 
December 28, 1996 TRICON had 166 and 296 Company-operated non-core
U.S. restaurants, respectively.

Results of Operations

     Revenues decreased $29 million in the quarter and $65
million year-to-date, or 1% for both periods.  Company-
operated restaurants revenue decreased $57 million or 3% in
the quarter and $105 million or 2% year-to-date.  The
declines primarily reflected fewer net Company-operated units as
a result of TRICON's initiatives to reduce its ownership of
the restaurant system.  In addition, the decrease in sales
was the result of transaction declines primarily due to
lapping a high level of transactions in 1996 because of the
successful introduction of Triple Decker Pizza.  These
declines were partially offset by higher effective net
pricing and increased revenue from TRICON's non-core U.S.
businesses of $14 million and $50 million for the quarter
and year-to-date, respectively.  The non-core increase was
primarily a result of the consolidation of CPK at the end of
the second quarter of 1996.  The $28 million or 25% increase
in the quarter and $40 million or 19% increase year-to-date
in franchise and license fee

</p><p class="break"> 63

revenues included $19 million of initial fees under a special KFC 
franchise renewal program, which will continue into the third 
quarter.  Including the initial franchise renewal fees expected to be
received in the third quarter, 96% of KFC's franchisees are
expected to renew their franchise agreements during 1997,
covering the next 20 years.  In addition, TRICON continues
to benefit from net new points of distribution by TRICON's
franchisees and licensees and the continuing franchise fees
from refranchised restaurants.

     TRICON measures same store sales for U.S. Company-
operated units.  Same store sales at Pizza Hut decreased 5%
for the quarter and 7% year-to-date reflecting fewer
customer transaction counts and in the quarter, reduced
pricing.  At Taco Bell, same store sales increased 2% for
the quarter and 3% year-to-date reflecting mix shifts into
higher-priced products such as Border Select Combos, Grilled
Steak Tacos and Fajita Wraps and higher pricing taken in
late 1996.  The year-to-date same store sales growth
benefited from the very successful first quarter Star Wars
promotion.  Same store sales at KFC increased 3% for the
quarter and 4% year-to-date due to a higher average guest
check, reflecting both pricing and new products, as well as
increased customer transactions.

     Company-operated restaurant margins increased almost 1
percentage point in the quarter and year-to-date  primarily due 
to higher effective pricing in excess of cost increases and the
favorable effects of net facility actions.  These margin
improvements were partially offset by an increase in
operating costs as a percent of revenues due to the effects
of decreased customer transaction counts at Pizza Hut U.S.
and Taco Bell U.S.  The effects of the increase in the
minimum wage were partially offset by favorable recurring
actuarial adjustments to prior years' casualty claim
liabilities.

     General, administrative and other expenses grew
$5 million in the quarter and $8 million year-to-date, or 2%
for both periods.  G&amp;A comprises general and administrative
expenses, other income and expense and equity income or loss
from investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  Included in
G&amp;A is an allocated amount reflecting TRICON's share of
overhead costs related to PepsiCo's shared administrative
expenses (see below).  The amounts allocated to TRICON were
based on the ratio of TRICON's revenues to PepsiCo's
revenues.  They are not necessarily indicative of the

expenses that TRICON would have incurred had it been a
separate, independent company.

     Excluding the allocated G&amp;A, G&amp;A increased $5 million
or 2% in the quarter and $5 million or 1% year-to-date.
These increases reflected increased field spending, the
effect of consolidating CPK and increased foreign exchange
losses, partially offset by equity income from TRICON's
investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 1997 compared to
losses in 1996.  Increased field spending primarily
reflected continued customer service improvement
initiatives.  The favorable swing in equity income primarily
reflected the absence of CPK's losses due to its
consolidation.

**   Because TRICON allocates its income tax expense to
     interim periods based on a forecasted full-year
     effective tax rate, the tax attributes associated with
     these net facility actions will continue to be
     recognized in TRICON's tax expense over the balance of
     the year.  Accordingly, the after-tax gain recognized
     in the 12 and 24 week periods is lower than the full-
     year amount.
     The 1997 full-year after-tax gain reflects the tax free
     gain from the refranchising of TRICON's restaurants in
     New Zealand to a new, independent publicly-traded
     company.
__________________________________________________________________________

     Unusual disposal charges of $39 million ($22 million
after-tax) in the second quarter of 1997 and $26 million
($17 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 1996 related
to disposal of the non-core U.S. businesses.  The 1997
charge adjusted the carrying amount of the non-core U.S.
businesses to their estimated fair market value based on the
actual selling price of three businesses and current
negotiations with probable 

</p><p class="break"> 65

buyers for the two remaining businesses.  The 1996 charge
adjusted the carrying amount of HNN, a non-core U.S. business, 
based upon a first quarter 1996 decision to dispose of its 
operating assets.  The adjustment was based on internal estimates.

     Reported operating profit increased $49 million or 27%
in the quarter and $65 million or 20% year-to-date. Ongoing
operating profit, which was adjusted to exclude the unusual
disposal charges, increased $88 million or 48% in the
quarter and $78 million or 22% year-to-date.  The increase
in ongoing operating profit in the quarter primarily
reflected the higher gains from net facility actions and the
increased franchise and license fees, primarily driven by
the initial KFC franchise renewal fees.  The year-to-date
gain was led by the increased franchise and license fees and
profit growth from Company-operated restaurants.

     TRICON's operations have been financed through its
operating cash flows, refranchising of restaurants and
investments by and advances from PepsiCo.  TRICON's interest
expense includes an allocation of PepsiCo's interest expense
(PepsiCo's weighted average interest rate applied to the
average balance of investments by and advances from PepsiCo
to TRICON) and interest expense on its external debt.
TRICON's external debt is primarily limited to capital lease
obligations associated with real estate and, to a much
lesser extent, assumed debt of acquired businesses and
international third-party debt.  TRICON is expected to have
a capital structure different from the capital structure in
the Condensed Combined Financial Statements (see Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Balance Sheet on page F-32) and
accordingly, the interest expense is not necessarily
indicative of the interest expense that TRICON would have
incurred as a separate, independent company or will incur in
future periods.  Interest expense, net declined 6% and 8% in
the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, reflecting a
lower average balance of net investments by and advances
from PepsiCo.

Income Taxes

     The 1997 reported effective tax rates of 27.5% in the
quarter and 34.2% year-to-date decreased 14.6 percentage points 
and 8.8 percentage points over 1996, respectively.  The 1997 
ongoing effective tax rates of 30.4% in the quarter and 35.3% 
year-to-date decreased 12.2 percentage points and 7.5 percentage 
points compared to the 1996 ongoing effective tax rates.  The 
decline in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to the 
tax free gain from the refranchising of TRICON's restaurants in New

</p><p class="break"> 66


Zealand to a new, independent publicly-traded company in
which TRICON has no ownership interest.  Excluding the New
Zealand gain, TRICON's ongoing effective tax rate would have
been 39.9% and 42.6% in the quarter and year-to-date,
respectively.

     Income tax expense was calculated as if TRICON filed
separate income tax returns.  As PepsiCo manages its tax
position on a consolidated basis, which takes into account
the results of all of its businesses, TRICON's effective tax
rate in the future could vary from its historical effective
tax rates.  TRICON's future effective tax rate will largely
depend on its structure and tax strategies as a separate,
independent company.

_______________________________________________________________________________

     Revenues increased $29 million for the quarter and $46
million year-to-date. The growth was driven by net
additional Company-operated units and higher effective net
pricing.  These gains were partially offset by the effects
of unfavorable currency translation and year-to-date, one
less four-week accounting period for Canada and Korea in the
first quarter of 1997.  Canada and Korea conformed their
reporting cycle to facilitate the quarterly closing process.

     Operating profit increased $73 million and $82 million
for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively.  The profit
growth primarily reflected increased net gains from facility
actions as summarized below, driven by the refranchising of
TRICON's restaurants in New Zealand.

</p><p class="break"> 67


     The positive impact of the higher effective net
pricing, the net additional Company-operated units and
higher franchise fees was partially offset by higher store
operating costs, reflecting increased incentive-based
compensation.

Combined Cash Flows

     TRICON's capital investments and acquisitions have been
financed by cash flow from operations, refranchising of
restaurants, or investments by and advances from PepsiCo.
Under PepsiCo's centralized cash management system, PepsiCo
deposits to TRICON's bank accounts sufficient cash to meet
TRICON's daily obligations and withdraws excess funds from
those accounts.  These transactions are included in
investments by and advances from PepsiCo in the Condensed
Combined Balance Sheet.

     The debt levels prior to the Distribution are not
indicative of the debt levels of TRICON as a separate,
independent company.  As an independent company, TRICON
expects to obtain initial debt funding of approximately $4.5 
billion through a $2 billion senior, unsecured five-year term 
loan facility and $2.5 billion under a senior, unsecured five-
year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.  A portion of
the latter facility will be available in the form of letters
of credit.  Interest rates are expected to be based on
LIBOR.  The facilities are expected to have a quarterly
facility fee as well as a semi-annual administrative fee.
TRICON expects to use substantially all of the initial debt
proceeds to settle certain amounts due to PepsiCo from TRICON 
and to declare and pay a dividend to PepsiCo just prior to the
Distribution.  Management believes that cash flows from its
refranchising initiatives and from its operating activities
in excess of capital spending will be sufficient to fund its
debt payments and future growth.

     Combined cash flow activity in 1997 primarily reflected
a greater reduction in investments by and advances from
PepsiCo of $388 million and reduced cash inflows from
operating activities of $64 million, partially offset by
increased cash proceeds from refranchising of restaurants of
$184 million, a favorable swing in net debt activities of
$126 million, as well as proceeds of $91 million from the
sale of non-core businesses.

     Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $64
million to $231 million in 1997.  The decrease was due to
increased working capital cash outflows of $63 million.  The
increased working capital cash outflows primarily reflected
an unfavorable swing in accounts payable and other current
liabilities and increased cash outflows related to prepaid
expenses, deferred income taxes and other current assets.

</p><p class="break"> 68


These cash outflows were partially offset by a favorable
swing in income taxes payable.  The unfavorable swing in
accounts payable and other current liabilities was primarily
due to the absence of casualty insurance liabilities in 1997
resulting from a change to premium-based insurance in 1997
compared to being largely self-insured in 1996.  The
increase in prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes and
other current assets reflected a 1997 premium deposit for
U.S. casualty insurance.  A comparable premium deposit was
not made in 1996 because TRICON was largely self-insured.

     Net cash provided by investing activities increased
$297 million to $315 million primarily reflecting increased
proceeds from refranchising of restaurants, proceeds from
the sale of non-core businesses and reduced capital
spending.

     Net cash used for financing activities increased $262
million to $572 million in 1997.  This reflected a greater
reduction in investments by and advances from PepsiCo,
partially offset by the favorable swing in net debt
activities in 1997.

     Free cash flow is the key internal measure used to
evaluate cash flow that investors may want to consider as an
indication of cash available for debt repayment and to fund
additional investments.  Free cash flow is not a measure
defined by generally accepted accounting principles.  This
measure is provided as a supplement, and not as an
alternative to cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles.

                                $ 546      $  313

     The increase in free cash flow primarily reflected the
increased proceeds from refranchising of restaurants, the
sale of non-core businesses in 1997 and reduced capital
spending.  These cash increases were partially offset by
reduced cash provided by operating activities.

Combined Financial Condition

     TRICON's negative operating working capital position,
which reflects the cash sales nature of TRICON's restaurant
operations, effectively provides additional capital for
investment.  Operating working capital, which excludes short-
term investments and short-term borrowings, was a negative
$403 million and $445 million for 1997 and 1996,
respectively.

</p><p class="break">  69


     The $42 million decrease primarily reflected a decline
in accounts payable and other current liabilities and an
increase in inventories partially offset by reduced cash and
cash equivalents and increased income taxes payable.  The
lower accounts payable and other current liabilities was due
to a reduction in days payable outstanding and the sale of
non-core businesses, as well as lower insurance accruals
reflecting TRICON's 1997 decision to change to premium-based
U.S. casualty insurance coverage compared to self-insuring
in 1996.

     Prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes and other
current assets declined slightly reflecting the sale of
three non-core U.S. businesses held for disposal and a
further reduction in the carrying amount of the two non-core
businesses to be sold.  These were partially offset by a
reclassification of amounts to prepaid taxes and the 1997
premium deposit for U.S. casualty insurance.

     The declines in Property, Plant and Equipment and
Intangible Assets included the effects of facility actions,
in addition to depreciation and amortization in excess of
capital spending.

     See the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet on
page F-32, which gives effect to TRICON's anticipated
capital structure.
    
                      Cautionary Statements


   
     From time to time, in both written reports and oral
statements, PepsiCo and TRICON may discuss expectations
regarding TRICON's future performance.  These "forward-looking
statements" are based on currently available competitive,
financial and economic data and TRICON's operating plans.
They are also inherently uncertain and investors must
recognize that events could turn out to be significantly
different than what was expected.  In addition, as discussed
in Management's Discussion and Analysis:

- TRICON's ability to execute its refranchising initiatives
  (pages 52-53 and 62) is subject to the continued interest and
  ability of existing and new franchisees to purchase
  TRICON's restaurants at prices TRICON considers
  appropriate.
    

- TRICON has never operated as a separate, independent
  entity and as a result, future performance will be
  impacted significantly by actions of a newly-formed
  management team and the implementation of its strategic
  objectives.

Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheet of TRICON Global
Restaurants, Inc. ("TRICON") as of December 28, 1996 and December 30, 1995
and the related combined statements of operations, cash flows and
shareholder's equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 28, 1996.  These combined financial statements are the
responsibility of TRICON's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TRICON
as of December 28, 1996 and December 30, 1995, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 28, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

     As discussed in Note 3 to the combined financial statements, TRICON in
1995 adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of."  As discussed in Notes 11 and 13 to the combined financial statements,
TRICON in 1994 changed its method for calculating the market-related value
of pension plan assets used in the determination of pension expense and
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," respectively.

Notes to Combined Financial Statements
(tabular dollars in millions)

Note 1 - PepsiCo, Inc.'s Proposed Spin-Off of its Restaurant Businesses

     In 1997, the Board of Directors of PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") approved
the spin-off of its core restaurant businesses to its shareholders as an
independent, publicly-traded company (the "Distribution").  The
Distribution is subject to a tax ruling by the Internal Revenue Service
that would allow it to be tax-free to shareholders subject to U.S. Federal
income taxes, various regulatory approvals, appropriate stock market
conditions and approval of a definitive plan by PepsiCo's Board of
Directors.  TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. ("TRICON"), the new company, is
composed of the worldwide operations of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC and
the non-core U.S. businesses held for disposal (see Note 3 on page F-11).
Immediately following the Distribution, PepsiCo will no longer have a
financial investment in TRICON.  However, TRICON shares will be owned by
PepsiCo's pension trust on behalf of PepsiCo's employees.  PepsiCo will
remain liable on certain existing contingent liabilities relating to
TRICON's businesses which were not able to be released, terminated or
replaced prior to the Distribution Date ("unreleased contingent
liabilities").  After the Distribution, TRICON will pay a fee to PepsiCo
for any unreleased contingent liabilities until they are released or
replaced by a qualified letter of credit.  TRICON will also fully indemnify
PepsiCo for any payments made under the unreleased contingent liabilities.
     TRICON expects to obtain initial debt funding and use substantially
all of the proceeds to settle certain amounts due to PepsiCo from TRICON
and to declare and pay a dividend to PepsiCo just prior to the
Distribution.  In addition, TRICON and PepsiCo will enter into several
agreements providing for the separation of the companies and governing
various relationships between TRICON and PepsiCo, including a Separation
Agreement, Tax Separation Agreement, Employee Programs Agreement and
Telecommunications, Software and Computing Services Agreement.
     The Combined Financial Statements included herein may not necessarily
be indicative of the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of TRICON in the future or had it operated as a separate, independent
company during the periods presented.  The Combined Financial Statements
included herein do not reflect any changes that may occur in the financing
and operations of TRICON as a result of the Distribution.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Combined Financial Statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

     Basis of Combination and Preparation. The accompanying Combined
Financial Statements of TRICON include the results of operations and assets
and liabilities directly related to TRICON's operations.  TRICON's
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Investments
in unconsolidated affiliates in which TRICON exercises significant

F-8
influence but not control are accounted for by the equity method and
TRICON's share of the net income or loss of its unconsolidated affiliates
is included in general, administrative and other expenses in the Combined
Statement of Operations.
     TRICON was allocated $53 million, $52 million and $50 million of
overhead costs related to PepsiCo's shared administrative functions in
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The allocation was based on TRICON's
revenue as a percent of PepsiCo's total revenue and the allocated costs are
included in general, administrative and other expenses in the Combined
Statement of Operations.  Management believes that such allocation
methodology is reasonable.  The expenses allocated to TRICON for these
services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have
been incurred if TRICON had been a separate, independent entity and had
otherwise managed these functions.  Subsequent to the Distribution, TRICON
will be required to manage these functions and will be responsible for the
expenses associated with the management of a public corporation.
     TRICON's operations have been financed through its operating cash
flows, refranchising of restaurants and investments by and advances from
PepsiCo.  TRICON's interest expense includes an allocation of PepsiCo's
interest expense (PepsiCo's weighted average interest rate applied to the
average balance of investments by and advances from PepsiCo to TRICON) and
interest expense on its external debt.  TRICON was allocated $275 million,
$316 million and $300 million of interest expense reflecting PepsiCo's
average interest rates of 6.2%, 6.6% and 6.4% in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  TRICON's external debt is primarily limited to capital lease
obligations associated with real estate and, to a much lesser extent,
assumed debt of acquired businesses and international third-party debt.
TRICON is expected to have a capital structure different from the capital
structure in the Combined Financial Statements and accordingly, interest
expense is not necessarily indicative of the interest expense that TRICON
would have incurred as a separate, independent company.
     Income tax expense was calculated as if TRICON filed separate income
tax returns.  As PepsiCo manages its tax position on a consolidated basis,
which takes into account the results of all of its businesses, TRICON's
effective tax rate in the future could vary from its historical effective
tax rates.  TRICON's future effective tax rate will largely depend on its
structure and tax strategies as a separate, independent company.
     Fiscal Year. TRICON's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in
December and, as a result, a fifty-third week is added every five or six
years.  The fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 consisted of 53 weeks.
     Direct Marketing Costs.  Direct marketing costs are reported in
occupancy and other operating expenses in the Combined Statement of
Operations and include costs of advertising and other marketing activities.
Direct marketing costs are charged to expense ratably in relation to
revenues over the year in which incurred.  Advertising expenses were $571
million, $570 million and $556 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
     Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses,
which are expensed as incurred, were $20 million, $17 million and $22
million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Stock-Based Employee Compensation.  TRICON measures stock-based
employee compensation cost in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related
interpretations.  Accordingly, compensation cost for PepsiCo stock option



F-9
grants to TRICON employees is measured as the excess of the quoted market
price of PepsiCo's capital stock at the grant date over the amount the
employee must pay for the stock.  PepsiCo's policy is to grant stock
options at fair market value at the date of grant.
     Derivative Instruments.  Gains and losses on futures contracts that
are designated and are effective as hedges of future commodity purchases
are deferred and included in the cost of the related raw materials when
purchased.  Changes in the value of futures contracts that TRICON uses to
hedge commodity purchases are highly correlated to the changes in the value
of the purchased commodity.  If the degree of correlation between the
futures contracts and the purchase contracts were to diminish such that the
two were no longer considered highly correlated, subsequent changes in the
value of the futures contracts would be recognized in income.
     Cash Equivalents.  Cash equivalents represent funds temporarily
invested (with original maturities not exceeding three months) as part of
managing day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements.
     Inventories.  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (computed on
the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.
     Property, Plant and Equipment.  Property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E)
are stated at cost, except for PP&amp;E that have been impaired, for which the
carrying amount is reduced to estimated fair market value.  Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:  5 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to
20 years for machinery and equipment.  Depreciation expense was $521
million, $555 million, and $519 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
     Intangible Assets.  Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis as follows:  20 years for reacquired franchise rights, 3 to 34 years
for trademarks and other identifiable intangibles and 20 years for
goodwill.  Amortization expense was $95 million, $109 million and $103
million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets to be Held and Used in the
Business.  TRICON reviews its long-lived assets related to each restaurant
to be held and used in the business semi-annually for impairment, or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable.  TRICON evaluates
restaurants using a "two-year history of operating losses" as its primary
indicator of potential impairment.  An impaired restaurant is written down
to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
TRICON generally measures estimated fair market value by discounting
estimated future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary
to estimate discounted future cash flows.  Accordingly, actual results
could vary significantly from such estimates.
     TRICON's methodology for determining and measuring impairment of its
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and enterprise-level goodwill was
changed in 1996 to conform with the methodology it uses for its restaurants
except (a) the recognition test for an investment in an unconsolidated
affiliate compares the investment to a forecast of TRICON's share of the
unconsolidated affiliate's undiscounted cash flows including interest and
taxes, compared to undiscounted cash flows before interest and taxes used
for restaurants and (b) enterprise-level goodwill is evaluated at a country
level instead of by individual restaurant.  The change in methodology had
no impact in 1996.
     Pre-opening Costs.  Costs associated with opening a new restaurant are
expensed as incurred.


F-10
     Refranchising Gains. Refranchising gains include gains on sales of
Company-operated restaurants to new and existing franchisees and the
related initial franchise fees.  Gains on restaurant refranchisings are
recognized when the sale transaction closes, the franchisee has a minimum
amount of the purchase price in at-risk equity and TRICON is satisfied that
the franchisee can meet its financial obligations.  Otherwise,
refranchising gains are deferred until those criteria have been met.
     Store Closure Costs. Store closure costs are recognized when a
decision is made to close a restaurant within the next twelve months.
     Store closure costs include the cost of writing-down the carrying
amount of a restaurant's assets to estimated fair market value less costs
of disposal, and the net present value of any remaining operating lease
payments after the expected closure date net of estimated sub-lease income.
     Franchise and License Fees. Franchise and license agreements are
executed for each point of distribution and provide the terms of the
arrangement between TRICON and the franchisee/licensee.  The franchise and
certain license agreements require the franchisee/licensee to pay an
initial, non-refundable fee.  The agreements also require continuing fees
based upon a percentage of sales.  Subject to franchisor approval, a
franchise agreement may be renewed upon expiration.
     Initial fees are recognized as revenue when TRICON has substantially
performed all initial services required by the franchising/licensing
agreement, which is generally upon opening.  Continuing fees are recognized
as earned with an appropriate provision for estimated uncollectible
amounts. Renewal fees are recognized in earnings when a renewal agreement
becomes effective.
     Territorial franchise agreements stipulate the area, number of
restaurants and the time frame for development in exchange for a
territorial franchise fee.  These fees are amortized on a straight line
basis over the life of the territory agreement.
     Direct costs incurred to secure and perform the required services
under the franchise and license agreements, which are not material, are
charged to expense as incurred.

___________________________________________________________________________

The non-core U.S. businesses charge of $246 million was a result of a
fourth quarter 1996 decision to dispose of TRICON's remaining non-core U.S.
businesses: California Pizza Kitchen ("CPK"), Chevys, D'Angelo Sandwich

F-11
Shops ("D'Angelo"),  and East Side Mario's ("ESM") and a first quarter 1996
decision to dispose of the operating assets of Hot 'n Now ("HNN").  The
charge represented a reduction of the carrying amounts of the non-core U.S.
businesses to estimated fair market value, less costs to sell.  The
estimated fair market value was determined by using estimated selling
prices, based primarily upon the opinion of an investment banking firm
retained to assist in the selling activity.   The remaining carrying amount
of the non-core U.S. restaurant assets of $333 million was included in
prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes and other current assets in the
1996 Combined Balance Sheet.  The non-core U.S. businesses contributed $394
million, $297 million and $281 million to revenues in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Excluding the unusual disposal charges in 1996 and the $120
million initial impact of adopting Statement of  Financial Accounting
Standard No. 121 ("SFAS 121"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" in 1995, the non-core
U.S. businesses incurred losses of $15 million ($12 million after-tax), $45
million ($37 million after-tax) and $42 million ($35 million after-tax) in
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Net facility actions reflected TRICON's initiatives to reduce its
percentage ownership of total system units by selling Company-operated
restaurants to new and existing franchisees and closing underperforming
stores, and impairment charges under SFAS 121:

*    Included initial franchise fees for both the U.S. and Worldwide of $22
     million in 1996 and $8 million in 1995.  See Note 4.

     TRICON early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the fourth
quarter of 1995.  The initial, noncash charge of $457 million ($324 million
after-tax), $120 million ($82 million after-tax) of which related to non-
core U.S. businesses, resulted from TRICON evaluating and measuring
impairment of restaurants to be used in the business at the individual
restaurant level.  Previously, impairment was evaluated and

F-12
measured if a restaurant concept was incurring operating losses and was
expected to incur operating losses in the future.  Because of the strong
operating profit history or prospects for each concept, no impairment
evaluation had been required in 1994.
     As a result of the reduced carrying amount of restaurants due to the
adoption of SFAS 121, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by
$40 million for the first three quarters of 1996 and by $17 million for the
fourth quarter of 1995.
     The recurring SFAS 121 impairment charge in 1996 resulted from the
semi-annual impairment evaluations of each restaurant to be used in the
business that either initially met the "two-year history of operating
losses" impairment indicator or was previously evaluated for impairment
and, due to changes in circumstances, a current forecast of future cash
flows would be expected to be significantly lower than the forecast used in
the prior evaluation.
     The fifty-third week in 1994 increased 1994 revenues and operating
profit by an estimated $172 million and $23 million, respectively.

Note 4 - Franchise and License Fees

Franchise and certain license arrangements for TRICON's traditional and non-
traditional points of distribution, respectively, provide for initial fees.
The agreements also require continuing fees based upon a percentage of
sales.  Initial franchise fees from refranchising activities arise from an
initiative adopted by TRICON in late 1994 to reduce its percentage
ownership of total system units by selling Company-operated units to new
and existing franchisees.  As disclosed in Note 2 on page F-10, initial
franchise fees from the refranchising activities are included as part of
refranchising gains.

Identifiable intangible assets primarily arose from the allocation of
purchase prices of businesses acquired.  Amounts assigned to such
identifiable intangibles were based on independent appraisals or internal
estimates.  Goodwill represents the residual purchase price after
allocation to all identifiable net assets.
     Accumulated amortization, included in the amounts above, was $603
million and $521 million at year-end 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Note 9 - Leases

TRICON has noncancellable commitments under both capital and long-term
operating leases, primarily for Company-operated restaurants.  Capital and
operating lease commitments expire at various dates through 2087 and, in
many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Most leases
require payment of related executory costs, which include property taxes,
maintenance and insurance.
     Future minimum commitments and sublease receivables under
noncancelable leases are set forth below:

Note 10 - Financial Instruments


Derivative Instruments
TRICON's policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading
purposes and TRICON has procedures in place to monitor and control their
use.
     TRICON's use of derivative instruments is currently limited to
commodity futures contracts traded on national exchanges, which are entered
into with the objective of reducing food costs.  Open contracts and
deferred gains and losses at year-end 1996 and 1995, as well as gains and
losses recognized as part of cost of sales in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were not
significant.






F-15
Fair Value
Except for guarantees issued by TRICON, the carrying amounts of TRICON's
financial instruments approximated market value.  The fair value of
guarantees issued by TRICON was $13 million in 1996 and $1 million in 1995
compared to a carrying amount of $0 for both years.  The fair values were
estimated using market quotes and calculations based on market rates.

Note 11 - Pension Plans

U.S. employees participate in PepsiCo sponsored noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans which cover substantially all full-time salaried
employees, as well as certain hourly employees.  Benefits generally are
based on years of service and compensation or stated amounts for each year
of service.  All plans but one are funded and contributions are made in
amounts not less than minimum statutory funding requirements nor more than
the maximum amount that can be deducted for U.S. income tax purposes.
     It is intended that TRICON will assume the existing defined benefit
pension plan obligations for TRICON's U.S. employees as of the Distribution
Date and trust assets from the funded plans will be transferred based upon
actuarial determinations in accordance with regulatory requirements.
     Net periodic U.S. pension expense allocated to TRICON was $10 million
in 1996, $5 million in 1995 and $5 million in 1994.  Net periodic pension
expense for the defined benefit pension plans for TRICON's foreign
operations was not significant.  TRICON will assume the foreign defined
benefit pension plan obligations as of the Distribution Date.  Any related
assets will be transferred.
     In 1994, PepsiCo changed the method for calculating the market-related
value of plan assets used in determining the return-on-assets component of
net periodic pension cost and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss
subject to amortization.  This change resulted in a noncash benefit in 1994
for TRICON of $5 million ($3 million after-tax) representing the cumulative
effect of the change related to TRICON for years prior to 1994.

Note 12 - Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

TRICON provides postretirement health care benefits to eligible retired
employees and their dependents, principally in the U.S. Salaried retirees
who have 10 years of service and attain age 55 are eligible to participate
in the postretirement benefit plans.  The plans are not funded and since
1994 have included retiree cost sharing.  Postretirement benefit expense
was $3 million in 1996, $2 million in 1995 and $3 million in 1994.

Note 13 - Postemployment Benefits Other Than to Retirees

Effective the beginning of 1994, TRICON adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112 ("SFAS 112"), "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits."  The principal effect to TRICON resulted from
accruing disability medical benefits to be provided to employees upon the
occurrence of an event.  Previously, these benefits were expensed when
incurred.  The cumulative effect charge upon adoption of SFAS 112, which
relates to years prior to 1994, was $7 million ($4 million after-tax).



F-16
Note 14 - Employee Stock Option Plans

TRICON  employees were granted stock options under PepsiCo's three long-
term incentive plans - the SharePower Stock Option Plan ("SharePower"), the
Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), and the Stock Option Incentive Plan
("SOIP").  Prior to 1997, SharePower options were granted annually to
essentially all full-time employees.  SharePower options generally become
exercisable ratably over 5 years from the grant date and must be exercised
within 10 years from the grant date.  Most LTIP options were granted every
other year to senior management employees.  Most of these options become
exercisable after 4 years and must be exercised within 10 years from the
grant date. In addition, the LTIP allows for grants of performance share
units ("PSU"s).  The maximum value of a PSU is fixed at the value of a
share of PepsiCo stock at the grant date and vests in 4 years from the
grant date.  Payment of PSUs are made in cash and/or stock and the payment
amount is determined based on the attainment of prescribed performance
goals.  Amounts expensed for PSUs for TRICON employees were $.9 million in
1996, $.6 million in 1995 and $1.8 million in 1994. SOIP options are for
middle-management employees and, prior to 1997, were granted annually.
SOIP options are exercisable after one year and must be exercised within 10
years after their grant date.  The total number of options granted to
TRICON employees under the PepsiCo stock option plans was 13.4 million in
1996, 7.2 million in 1995 and 14.1 million in 1994.
     Immediately following the Distribution, nonvested SharePower stock
options and 1996 and 1997 option grants under LTIP and SOIP held by TRICON
employees will be replaced with TRICON stock option awards.  The TRICON
awards will have the same ratio of the exercise price per option to the
market value per share, the same aggregate difference between market value
and exercise price and the same vesting provisions, option periods and
other terms and conditions as the PepsiCo options they replace.  Vested
SharePower options and options granted under LTIP and SOIP before 1996 held
by TRICON employees will remain as PepsiCo stock options. The number of
options and exercise prices will be adjusted to compensate for the market
value of TRICON shares distributed to PepsiCo shareholders.  At December
28, 1996, there were approximately 38 million PepsiCo stock options held by
TRICON employees.  That amount includes an aggregate of approximately 16
million options that are subject to replacement with TRICON stock option
awards.  TRICON cannot currently determine the number of shares of its
common stock that will be subject to substitute awards after the
Distribution.
     TRICON adopted the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," but continues to measure stock-based compensation cost in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and its related
interpretations. If TRICON had measured compensation cost for the PepsiCo
stock options granted to its employees in 1996 and 1995 under the fair
value based method prescribed by SFAS 123, the net loss would have been
changed to the pro forma amounts set forth below:

                                1996     1995
Net Loss
  Reported                       $53     $132
  Pro forma                      $70     $136




F-17

     The fair value of PepsiCo stock options granted to TRICON employees
used to compute pro forma net income disclosures were estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the
following weighted average assumptions used by PepsiCo:

                                1996         1995

Risk free interest rate          6.0%         6.2%
Expected life                  6 years     5 years
Expected volatility               20%          20%
Expected dividend yield          1.5%        1.75%

     The weighted-average fair value of PepsiCo stock options granted to
TRICON employees during 1996 was $8.87 and during 1995 was $5.54.
     The pro forma amounts above are not necessarily representative of the
effects of stock-based awards on future pro forma net income because
(1)future grants of employee stock options by TRICON management may not be
comparable to awards made to employees while TRICON was a part of PepsiCo,
(2) the assumptions used to compute the fair value of any stock option
awards will be specific to TRICON and therefore may not be comparable to
the PepsiCo assumptions used and (3) they exclude the pro forma
compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted before 1995.

     The valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets increased by
$56 million in 1996 primarily due to additions related to current year
operating losses and temporary differences in a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions.



F-19
      The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and
foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration
is not practicable.
      Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $374 million at year-end
1996 are available to reduce future tax of certain subsidiaries and are
related to a number of foreign and state jurisdictions.  Of these
carryforwards, $4 million expire in 1997, $316 million expire at various
times between 1998 and 2010 and $54 million may be carried forward
indefinitely.

Note 16 - Business Segments

TRICON is engaged principally in developing, operating, franchising and
licensing the worldwide Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC concepts.  TRICON
also operates other non-core U.S. concepts, including CPK, Chevys,
D'Angelo, ESM and HNN, which were held for disposal at the end of 1996 (see
Note 3).
     Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC operate throughout the U.S. and in 83, 16
and 73 countries and territories outside the U.S, respectively.  Principal
international markets include Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New
Zealand, Spain and the U.K.  At year-end 1996, TRICON has investments in
several unconsolidated affiliates outside the U.S. which operate KFC and
Pizza Hut restaurants, the most significant of which are located in Japan
and the U.K.
     TRICON year-end investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled $228
million in 1996 and $382 million in 1995.  The decrease in 1996 reflected
the consolidation of CPK, previously an unconsolidated equity investment,
at the end of the second quarter of 1996.  CPK was consolidated as a result
of PepsiCo obtaining majority control of CPK's Board of Directors at the
end of the second quarter of 1996.

Note 17 - Related Party Transactions

TRICON purchases beverage products from the Pepsi-Cola Company and
equipment, food and paper from PepsiCo Food Systems (PFS), both operating
divisions of PepsiCo.  The amounts purchased in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were
$2.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.  In May 1997,
TRICON entered into a five-year Sales and Distribution Agreement with PFS
to purchase the majority of its food and supplies for Company-operated
stores, subject to PFS maintaining certain quality and service performance
levels.  The Sales and Distribution Agreement becomes effective upon the
closing of the sale by PepsiCo of the assets and business of PFS to
AmeriServe Food Distribution, Inc. ("AmeriServe"), pursuant to a definitive
agreement dated as of May 23, 1997.
     KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are each expected to enter into a multi-
year agreement with Pepsi-Cola regarding the sale of Pepsi-Cola's brands of
beverage products to TRICON's U.S. Company-operated units.
     PepsiCo will remain liable on certain existing contingent liabilities
relating to TRICON's businesses which were not able to be released,
terminated or replaced prior to the Distribution Date ("unreleased
contingent liabilities").  After the Distribution, TRICON will pay a fee to
PepsiCo for any unreleased contingent liabilities until they are released
or replaced by a qualified letter of credit.  TRICON will also fully
indemnify PepsiCo for any payments made under the unreleased contingent
liabilities.
     In contemplation of the Distribution, TRICON and PepsiCo will enter
into certain agreements providing for the separation of the companies.  See
Note 1 on page F-8.

Note 18 - Contingencies

TRICON is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,
taxes, environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of
business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in
excess of amounts already recognized arising from such claims or
contingencies is not likely to have a material adverse effect on TRICON's
annual results of operations or financial condition.  TRICON was directly
or indirectly contingently liable under guarantees for $150 million and $77
million at year-end 1996 and 1995, respectively.  At year-end 1996, $74
million represented contingent liabilities to lessors as a result of TRICON
assigning its interest in and obligations under real estate leases as a
condition to the refranchising of Company-operated restaurants.  The $74
million represented the present value of the minimum payments of the
assigned leases, excluding any renewal option periods, discounted at
PepsiCo's pre-tax cost of debt.  PepsiCo's pre-tax cost of debt is not
necessarily indicative of TRICON's pre-tax cost of debt as a separate,
independent company.  On a nominal basis, the contingent liability
resulting from the assigned leases was $115 million.  The balance of the
contingent liabilities primarily reflected guarantees to support financial
arrangements of certain unconsolidated affiliates and other restaurant
franchisees.

Notes:

(a)  Operating profit included certain items affecting comparability as
  summarized below.  Net facility actions represent the net gains/(losses)
  from sales of restaurants to new and existing franchisees, closing other
  restaurants and SFAS 121 impairment charges for restaurants to be used in
  the business.  The SFAS 121 impairment charges represent the ongoing
  application of SFAS 121 in 1996 and the initial impact of adopting it in
  1995 (see Note 3).  The depreciation and amortization reduction for the
  first three quarters of 1996 arose from the adoption of SFAS 121 at the
  beginning of the fourth quarter of 1995, which reduced the carrying amount
  of certain restaurants to be held and used in the business.

   have been prepared in conformity with the accounting principles applied
   in the TRICON audited combined financial statements for the year ended
   December 28, 1996.  In the opinion of management, this information
   includes all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation.
   The results for the 12 and 24 weeks are not necessarily indicative of
   the results expected for the year.
2. During the first half of 1997, TRICON sold ESM, Chevys and HNN for $105
   million, composed of $91 million in cash and a $14 million note.
3. TRICON recorded an unusual charge of $39 million ($22 after-tax) in the
   second quarter of 1997 to adjust the carrying amounts of the non-core U.S.
   businesses and $26 million ($17 million after-tax) related to the first
   quarter 1996 decision to dispose of HNN's operating assets. The adjustment
   was based on the actual selling prices of the three businesses and current
   negotiations with probable buyers for the two remaining businesses, CPK and
   D'Angelo. As of June 14, 1997, the carrying amount of the assets held for
   disposal was $131 million. We anticipate that CPK and D'Angelo will be sold
   by the end of 1997.

   Excluding the unusual charges of $39 million and $26 million described above,
   the non-core U.S. businesses sold or held for disposal contributed the
   following:


                             12 Weeks Ended           24 Weeks Ended_
   ($ in millions)       6/14/97     6/15/96       6/14/97    6/15/96

   Net Revenues              $88         $74          $191       $141
   Net Income/(Loss)         $ 4         $(2)         $  6       $ (7)

4. Included in net facility actions were recurring impairment charges of
   $39 million ($25 million after-tax) and $18 million ($12 million after-
   tax) in the second quarter of 1997 and 1996 to reduce the carrying
   amounts of certain restaurants to be held and used. These charges
   resulted from the semi-annual impairment evaluation of all restaurants
   that either initially met the "two-year history of operating losses"
   impairment indicator that is used to identify potentially impaired
   restaurants or were previously evaluated for impairment and, due to
   changes in circumstances, a current forecast of future cash flows would
   be expected to be significantly lower than the forecast used in the
   prior evaluation.
5. The unaudited pro forma shareholder's equity/(deficit) gives effect to
   a $4.5 billion cash distribution to PepsiCo in repayment of certain
   amounts due and a dividend.
6. On August 14, 1997 PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") announced its Board of
   Directors approved a formal plan to spin-off TRICON to shareholders. 
   PepsiCo also announced that it received a ruling from the Internal Revenue
   Service that the spin-off would be tax free to PepsiCo and its shareholders.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

The historical combined financial statements reflect periods during which
TRICON did not operate as a separate, independent Company; certain
estimates, assumptions and allocations were made in preparing such
financial statements.  Therefore such historical combined financial
statements do not necessarily reflect the combined results of operations or
financial position that would have existed had TRICON been a separate,
independent company.
     The Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements should be read
in conjunction with the historical combined financial statements of TRICON
and the notes thereto contained in this Information Statement.  The pro
forma condensed combined financial information is presented for
informational purposes only and does not purport to reflect the results of
operations or financial position of TRICON or the results of operations or
financial position that would have occurred had TRICON been operated as a
separate, independent company.

Note 1 - The pro forma adjustments to the accompanying historical combined
statements of operations for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996 and
for the 24 weeks ended June 14, 1997 were:
(a)  To eliminate the effect of TRICON's non-core U.S. businesses composed
     of CPK, Chevys, D'Angelo, ESM and HNN.  TRICON has disposed of or
     expects to dispose of these businesses in 1997.
(b)  To record the net effect of eliminating the PepsiCo interest expense
     allocation and recording interest expense based on $4.5 billion of
     external debt TRICON expects to incur prior to the Distribution Date.
     TRICON's interest expense was calculated using a weighted average
     expected borrowing rate of 6.67%.  The weighted average borrowing rate
     assumed approximately 40% of the borrowings were effectively converted
     to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps, with the balance
     indexed to LIBOR.  TRICON's actual borrowing rate may vary based upon
     TRICON's credit rating, changes in market rates and potential long-
     term debt issuances.  A 1/8 percentage point change in the assumed
     financing rate would change interest expense by $5.6 million annually
     and $2.6 million for the 24 weeks ended June 14, 1997.
(c)  To reflect the estimated tax impact for the pro forma adjustments (a)
     and (b).
(d)  Pro Forma shares and equivalents used to compute pro forma net income
     per share was based upon 152 million shares of TRICON common stock
     adjusted for the dilutive effect of TRICON stock options.  The 152
     million shares reflected an estimate of the shares to be issued at the
     Distribution Date based on a distribution ratio of one share of TRICON
     stock for every 10 shares of PepsiCo stock.

Note 2 - The pro forma adjustments to the accompanying historical combined
balance sheet at June 14, 1997 were:
(a)  To eliminate the effect of TRICON's non-core U.S. businesses held for
     disposal, composed of CPK and D'Angelo.  TRICON expects to dispose of
     these businesses in 1997.
(b)  To record the estimated $4.5 billion of external debt TRICON expects
     to incur prior to the Distribution Date to fund a $4.5 billion cash





F-33




     distribution to PepsiCo in repayment of certain amounts due and a
     dividend.  TRICON plans to establish a $2 billion senior, unsecured
     five-year term loan facility and $2.5 billion under a senior,
     unsecured five-year revolving credit facility.  Interest rates are
     expected to be based on LIBOR.  Income taxes payable reflects the
     estimated tax impact of interest expense described in Note 1(b) above.
(c)  To record the issuance of 152 million shares of TRICON common stock
     with no par value (at a distribution ratio of one share of TRICON
     stock for every 10 shares of PepsiCo stock held on the Record Date)
     and the elimination of PepsiCo's investment.

                              SEPARATION AGREEMENT


        SEPARATION  AGREEMENT,  dated  as of  _______  ___,  1997  (as  amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified,  this "Agreement"),  by and between PepsiCo,
Inc., a North Carolina corporation  ("PepsiCo"),  and TRICON Global Restaurants,
Inc., a North  Carolina  corporation  ("TRICON")  and, as of the date hereof,  a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

        WHEREAS,  PepsiCo has engaged in the restaurant business through various
of its subsidiaries and affiliates  (PepsiCo and its subsidiaries and affiliates
(other  than the  members  of the  TRICON  Group  (as such  term is  hereinafter
defined)) are collectively referred to herein as the "PepsiCo Group");

   
        WHEREAS, PepsiCo has decided to consolidate the assets and operations of
its  worldwide  KFC,  Pizza  Hut and Taco  Bell  businesses  (collectively,  the
"Restaurant  Businesses")  into TRICON and TRICON's  subsidiaries and affiliates
(TRICON and its subsidiaries and affiliates are collectively  referred to herein
as the  "TRICON  Group"),  and to  distribute  the  Common  Stock of TRICON on a
ten-for-one basis to the holders of PepsiCo Capital Stock (the  "Distribution");
and
    

   
        WHEREAS, on or before October 6, 1997 (the "Distribution Date"), PepsiCo
will  transfer  to the  Agent  (as such term is  hereinafter  defined),  for the
benefit  of the  holders  of record  of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock at the close of
business on September 19, 1997 (the "Record  Date"),  without any  consideration
being  paid by such  holders,  the shares of TRICON  Common  Stock then owned by
PepsiCo;
    

        NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  mutual  promises  contained
herein,  the Parties (as such term is defined in Section 16 hereof) hereby agree
as follows:

   
        Section  1. The  Distribution.  On or prior  to the  Distribution  Date,
PepsiCo will transfer to BankBoston,  N.A., as distribution agent (the "Agent"),
for the  benefit of holders of record of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock at the close of
business on the Record  Date,  the shares of TRICON  Common  Stock then owned by
PepsiCo, together with an irrevocable voting rights proxy in favor of the Agent.
Prior to the Distribution  Date, the Parties shall take such action with respect
to the TRICON  Common Stock as is required to complete the  Distribution  on the
basis of one share of TRICON  Common  Stock  for  every  ten  shares of  PepsiCo
Capital Stock  outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date.  PepsiCo
shall  instruct  the Agent to  distribute  such TRICON  shares to the holders of
record of PepsiCo Capital Stock at the close of business on the Record Date. All
of the  shares of TRICON so issued  shall be fully paid and  nonassessable.  The
Distribution shall be effective as of 11:59:59 p.m. on the Distribution Date.

        Section 2. Governance Documents.  TRICON shall take all action necessary
such that, on the Distribution  Date, the Restated Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of TRICON, and all benefit plans of TRICON, shall be substantially in the
forms filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission as exhibits to the Form
10 relating to the Distribution (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified,
the "Form 10").
    

        Section 3.  Books,  Records,  Services  and Access to  Information.  (a)
Except as otherwise  provided in the attachments  hereto,  for a period of up to
twelve months from and after the  Distribution  Date (or such shorter  period as
set forth on Schedule A hereto),  each Party shall make  available to the other,
during  normal  business  hours  and in a manner  which  will  not  unreasonably
interfere  with such  Party's  business,  the  services  set forth on Schedule A
hereto  (collectively  "Transitional  Services") to the extent that the same are
reasonably  required to assist in effecting an orderly transition  following the
Distribution.  Except as  otherwise  provided  in the  attachments  hereto,  the
initial terms upon which  Transitional  Services  shall be provided to TRICON or
PepsiCo, as the case may be, are set forth on Schedule A hereto.

        (b) From and after the  Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo shall afford TRICON
and its authorized  employees and  representatives  reasonable access (including
access to persons or firms  possessing  relevant  information  and  records) and
reasonable  duplicating rights during normal business hours to, or, at PepsiCo's
option, copies of, all records,  books, contracts,  instruments,  data and other
information (collectively,  "Information") within the PepsiCo Group's possession
relating to any member of the TRICON Group, insofar as such access or copies are
reasonably required by TRICON.

        (c) TRICON  shall  afford to PepsiCo and its  authorized  employees  and
representatives   reasonable  access  (including  access  to  persons  or  firms
possessing relevant  information and records) and reasonable  duplicating rights
during  normal  business  hours to,  or, at  TRICON's  option,  copies  of,  all
Information within the TRICON Group's  possession  relating to any member of the
PepsiCo  Group,  insofar as such  access or copies are  reasonably  required  by
PepsiCo.

        (d)  Within 45 days after the  Distribution  Date,  each of PepsiCo  and
TRICON shall provide the other with such indices or  descriptions of Information
as it  may  maintain  relating  to the  other  or the  other's  subsidiaries  or
affiliates.   Information   may  be  required  under  this  Section  3,  without
limitation, for audit, accounting,  claims, litigation and tax purposes, as well
as for purposes of fulfilling disclosure and reporting  obligations.  In lieu of
retaining  any  specific  Information,  either  Party may, in writing,  offer to
deliver  such  Information  to the other  Party.  If such offer is not  accepted
within 90 days,  the  Information  so offered  shall be retained or destroyed in
accordance with PepsiCo's  Record Retention  Policy.  If such offer is accepted,
the Party accepting delivery shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of the
delivery.  Each Party shall  maintain the  Information  in  accordance  with the
manner it treats similar material relating to its ongoing business.

        (e) At all times from and after the  Distribution  Date, each Party will
use its  reasonable  best efforts to make  available to the other,  upon written
request,  its  officers,  directors,  employees  and agents as  witnesses to the
extent that the same may  reasonably be required in  connection  with any legal,
administrative  or other proceedings in which the requesting Party may from time
to time be involved.

        (f)  Except as  otherwise  specifically  provided  for  herein,  a Party
providing Information, Transitional Services or witnesses to the other hereunder
shall be  entitled  to receive  from the  recipient,  upon the  presentation  of
appropriate  invoices therefor,  payments for such amounts relating to supplies,
disbursements,  and such other costs and out-of-pocket  expenses as are provided
for on Schedule A hereto, or which may be reasonably  incurred in providing such
Information,  Transitional  Services  or  witnesses.  Invoices  shall be due and
payable within thirty (30) days of receipt.  Interest shall accrue on any unpaid
amount at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum.

        (g) PepsiCo shall arrange for the  transportation of existing  corporate
records in its possession  relating  exclusively  to the Restaurant  Businesses,
including original  corporate minute books, stock ledgers and certificates,  and
corporate seals of each corporation included in the group of which TRICON is the
parent corporation,  and all active agreements,  deeds to real property,  active
litigation  files and  filings  with  foreign  governments,  if any, to TRICON's
address set forth in Section 23 hereof.  PepsiCo shall provide TRICON with lists
of trademarks, patents and copyrights of TRICON and its subsidiaries.

        Section 4.  Confidentiality.  Each member of the  PepsiCo  Group and the
TRICON Group shall hold, and cause each of their respective officers, employees,
agents,  consultants and advisors to hold, in strict confidence,  all non-public
Information  concerning the other Party  furnished it by such other Party or its
representatives  pursuant to this Agreement,  unless  compelled to disclose such
Information by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of counsel,
by other requirements of law (in which case such Party shall promptly notify the
other Party so that the other Party may seek a protective  or other  appropriate
remedy);  and each Party shall not release or disclose such  Information  to any
other person, except its auditors,  attorneys,  financial advisors,  bankers and
other  consultants  and  advisors who shall be bound by the  provisions  of this
Section  4.  Each  Party  shall be  deemed  to have  satisfied  its  obligations
hereunder with respect to confidential  Information  supplied by the other Party
if it  exercises  the  same  care as it does  with  respect  to  preserving  the
confidentiality of its own similar information.

        Section 5.  Indemnification.  (a)  Effective on the  Distribution  Date,
TRICON  agrees to indemnify  and hold  harmless each member of the PepsiCo Group
and each of their respective officers, directors,  employees and agents from and
against any and all  losses,  liabilities,  claims,  suits,  damages,  costs and
expenses (including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees and any and
all  expenses  reasonably  incurred in  investigating,  preparing  or  defending
against any pending or seriously threatened  litigation or claim) (collectively,
"Losses")  arising  out of or  related  in any  manner  to any item set forth on
Schedule B hereto.  Similarly,  effective on the  Distribution  Date,  except as
otherwise  provided in the attachments  hereto,  PepsiCo agrees to indemnify and
hold  harmless  each  member of the  TRICON  Group and each of their  respective
officers,  directors,  employees  and agents from and against any and all Losses
arising  out of or  related  in any  manner to any item set forth on  Schedule C
hereto.

   
        (b) If any  action is  brought  or any claim is made  against a Party or
person in respect of which  indemnity may be sought  pursuant to subsection 5(a)
above  (the  "Indemnitee"),  the  Indemnitee  shall,  within  ten days after the
receipt of information  indicating that an action or claim is likely,  notify in
writing the Party from whom  indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") of the
institution of the action or the making of the claim,  and the Indemnitor  shall
have the right, and at the request of the Indemnitee, shall have the obligation,
to assume the  defense  of the  action or claim,  including  the  employment  of
counsel.  If the  Indemnitor  assumes  the  defense of the action or claim,  the
Indemnitor  shall be  entitled  to settle  the  action or claim on behalf of the
Indemnitee  without  the prior  written  consent of the  Indemnitee  unless such
settlement  would  materially  affect the ongoing  business or employment of the
Indemnitee.
    

        (c) The Indemnitee  shall have the right to employ its own counsel,  but
the  fees and  expenses  of that  counsel  shall  be the  responsibility  of the
Indemnitee  unless (i) the employment of that counsel shall have been authorized
in writing by the  Indemnitor  in  connection  with the defense of the action or
claim; (ii) the Indemnitor shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the
defense of such action or claim; or (iii) such Indemnitee  shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or
additional to those  available to the  Indemnitor  (in which case the Indemnitor
shall not have the right to direct any different  defense of the action or claim
on behalf of the Indemnitee).  The Indemnitee shall, in any event, be kept fully
informed  of the  defense  of any such  action  or claim.  Except  as  expressly
provided  above,  in the event that the  Indemnitor  shall not  previously  have
assumed the defense of an action or claim,  at such time as the Indemnitor  does
assume the defense of the action or claim,  the Indemnitor  shall not thereafter
be liable to any Indemnitee for legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnitee in  investigating,  preparing or defending against such action or
claim.

        (d)  Anything in this  Section 5 to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the
Indemnitor  shall  not be  liable  for any  settlement  of any  claim or  action
effected  without  its written  consent;  provided,  however,  that if after due
notice the Indemnitor  refuses to defend a claim or action, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to defend and/or settle such claim or action,  and the Indemnitee
shall not be precluded from making a claim against the Indemnitor for reasonable
expenses and  liabilities  resulting  from such  defense  and/or  settlement  in
accordance with this Section 5.

        (e)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions of this Section 5, there
may be  particular  actions  or claims  which  reasonably  could  result in both
Parties being liable to the other under the  indemnification  provisions of this
Agreement. In such events, the Parties shall endeavor,  acting reasonably and in
good faith,  to agree upon a manner of conducting  the defense and settlement of
the action or claim with a view to minimizing  the legal expenses and associated
costs  that might  otherwise  be  incurred  by the  Parties,  such as, by way of
illustration only, agreeing to use the same legal counsel.

        (f) The indemnification  provisions of this Section 5 shall not inure to
the benefit of any third  party.  By way of  illustration  only,  an insurer who
would  otherwise  be  obligated  to pay any claim  shall not be  relieved of the
responsibility with respect thereto, or, solely by virtue of the indemnification
provisions hereof,  have any subrogation  rights with respect thereto,  it being
expressly  understood  and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall
be  entitled  to a  "windfall"  (i.e.,  a benefit  they would not be entitled to
receive in the  absence of the  indemnification  provisions)  by virtue of these
indemnification provisions.

        Section 6. Taxes.  PepsiCo and TRICON have entered into a Tax Separation
Agreement,  substantially  in the  form  attached  hereto  as  Attachment  1 (as
amended,  supplemented or otherwise  modified,  the "Tax Agreement"),  regarding
their  respective  rights and  obligations  with  respect to taxes of the TRICON
Group  for  all  periods  through  the  Distribution   Date  and  certain  other
tax-related  matters.  In the event of a conflict  between  the terms of the Tax
Agreement and the terms of this Agreement,  the terms of the Tax Agreement shall
govern.

        Section 7.  Employee  Benefits.  PepsiCo and TRICON have entered into an
Employee  Programs  Agreement,  substantially  in the form  attached  hereto  as
Attachment 2 (as amended,  supplemented  or otherwise  modified,  the  "Employee
Programs Agreement"),  which allocates assets,  liabilities and responsibilities
between them with respect to certain employee compensation and benefit plans and
programs and certain other related  matters.  In the event of a conflict between
the Employee  Programs  Agreement and the terms of this Agreement,  the terms of
the Employee Programs Agreement shall govern.

        Section 8. Telecommunications,  Software and Computing Services. PepsiCo
and TRICON  have  entered  into a  Telecommunications,  Software  and  Computing
Services  Agreement,  substantially  in the form attached hereto as Attachment 3
(as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "T,S&amp;C Agreement"), setting
forth the  arrangements  between the Parties with respect to internal  software,
third party agreements,  telecommunications  services and computing services. In
the  event of a  conflict  between  the  T,S&amp;C  Agreement  and the terms of this
Agreement, the terms of the T,S&amp;C Agreement shall govern.

        Section 9. Transfer of Entities, Operations, Assets and Liabilities. (a)
Except  as set  forth on  Schedule  D hereto,  prior to the  Distribution  Date,
PepsiCo  and  TRICON  shall  use  reasonable  efforts  to  cause  the  entities,
operations, assets and corresponding liabilities of the Restaurant Businesses to
be included as part of the TRICON Group.  Both Parties agree to take such action
as may be necessary or appropriate, prior to the Distribution Date, to cause all
such restaurant-related  assets and liabilities (including,  without limitation,
all agreements relating thereto), except as provided on Schedule D hereto, to be
properly  conveyed  or  assigned  to TRICON  or the  appropriate  subsidiary  or
affiliate of TRICON.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including,
without limitation,  the Schedules and Attachments  hereto),  PepsiCo shall bear
the reasonable costs of such conveyances.

        (b) Except as expressly provided herein, TRICON agrees to assume and pay
all contracts,  obligations  and liabilities of each member of the PepsiCo Group
associated in any way with the  Restaurant  Businesses  and/or the Casual Dining
Businesses (as such term is hereinafter  defined),  whether  accrued,  absolute,
contingent or otherwise,  and whether due or to become due,  including,  without
limitation,  all  obligations  of any member of the  PepsiCo  Group  acting as a
guarantor  of  obligations  associated  in any way  with  any of the  Restaurant
Businesses and/or the Casual Dining Businesses, and all obligations under leases
and other executory  contracts and  liabilities,  whether arising as a result of
the transactions  contemplated hereby,  existing on the date hereof, or based on
facts or actions arising on or prior to the  Distribution  Date,  whether or not
such obligations shall have been disclosed herein,  and whether or not reflected
on the opening balance sheet of the TRICON Group prepared pursuant to Section 13
hereof (the "Opening Balance Sheet").  For purposes of this Agreement,  the term
"Casual Dining  Businesses" shall mean California Pizza Kitchen,  Chevys Mexican
Restaurants,  Chimayo Grill,  D'Angelo Sandwich Shops, East Side Mario's and Hot
`n Now.

        (c) In the event that the transfer of all such assets and liabilities is
not accomplished by the  Distribution  Date, the Parties agree that TRICON shall
have de facto control and equitable  ownership of the entities,  operations  and
assets,  and de  facto  responsibility  for  the  obligations  and  liabilities,
intended to be transferred to the TRICON Group;  provided,  however, that if any
uncompleted steps financially affect either PepsiCo or TRICON, the Parties agree
to use their  respective  best efforts to equitably  resolve any such  financial
impact.

        (d)    This Section 9 shall not inure to the benefit of any third party.

   
        Section 10. Letters of Credit,  Guarantees  and Contingent  Liabilities.
(a) TRICON shall use its best efforts to cause the  beneficiaries  of all of the
PepsiCo Group's letters of credit,  guarantees and other contingent  liabilities
relating to any of the  Restaurant  Businesses or the Casual  Dining  Businesses
(including,   without  limitation,   commercial  letters  of  credit,  financing
guarantees, performance guarantees, lease guarantees, comfort letters, insurance
and workers' compensation liabilities, and the letters of credit, guarantees and
other contingent liabilities identified on Schedule E hereto) (collectively, the
"Restaurant Contingent  Liabilities") which will not have expired on or prior to
the Distribution  Date, to release and terminate all such Restaurant  Contingent
Liabilities  on or  prior to the  Distribution  Date  and,  where  necessary  or
appropriate,  to accept substitute  letters of credit,  guarantees or contingent
liabilities  issued  for  the  account  of  TRICON  or to post  sufficient  cash
collateral  on behalf of TRICON.  TRICON  hereby  agrees to provide to  PepsiCo,
prior to the  Distribution  Date,  a  schedule  (the "PHI  Contingent  Liability
Schedule")  listing all of Pizza Hut,  Inc.'s letters of credit,  guarantees and
other contingent liabilities relating to any of the Restaurant Businesses or the
Casual Dining  Businesses  which have not been released,  terminated or replaced
with a Qualified Letter of Credit (as such term is hereinafter defined). The PHI
Contingent Liability Schedule shall supplement, and be incorporated by reference
into, Schedule E hereto. From and after the Distribution Date, TRICON will pay a
fee  based  upon the  maximum  exposure  related  to any  Restaurant  Contingent
Liabilities  which  were  not  released,  terminated  or  replaced  prior to the
Distribution  Date.  Such fee will be structured  as follows:  (i) for the first
year  following  the  Distribution  Date,  the fee will be  consistent  with the
pricing of TRICON's  senior  credit  facility as in effect from time to time and
will be expressed as a percentage of the value of the underlying  exposure,  and
(ii)  thereafter,  the  fee  will be  equal  to the  current  market  value,  as
determined  by The Chase  Manhattan  Bank,  for  replacing  all such  Restaurant
Contingent  Liabilities that have not yet been released,  terminated or replaced
by a Qualified  Letter of Credit.  Such fee shall be payable  monthly in advance
until such time as each such Restaurant  Contingent Liability has been released,
terminated  or  replaced  by a  Qualified  Letter  of  Credit  (as such  term is
hereinafter defined).  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  TRICON shall at all times
indemnify  and hold  harmless  each member of the PepsiCo Group from and against
all losses, liabilities and obligations incurred with respect to such Restaurant
Contingent  Liabilities.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,  TRICON shall,  upon
demand,  reimburse  PepsiCo within ten days for any amounts actually paid by any
member of the  PepsiCo  Group  with  respect to any such  Restaurant  Contingent
Liabilities.

        (b) For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the term  "Qualified  Letter  of
Credit"  shall  mean an  irrevocable,  transferable  letter of credit  issued to
PepsiCo or its  relevant  subsidiary  or affiliate by a bank that is an A Credit
(as such term is  hereinafter  defined),  substantially  in the form attached as
Schedule F hereto, with a term extending to the last possible expiration date of
the Restaurant Contingent Liabilities covered thereby and with a maximum drawing
amount  that  shall  equal the full  amount  of all  remaining  obligations  and
foreseeable claims under the Restaurant  Contingent  Liabilities covered thereby
(assuming the exercise of all extension  options with respect to the  underlying
obligations).  In the event of any change in the law regarding letters of credit
generally  that  affects the  language in a Qualified  Letter of Credit,  TRICON
shall,  at the  request of  PepsiCo,  provide a new  Qualified  Letter of Credit
containing  modifying language as approved by PepsiCo. The language contained in
the form of letter of credit attached as Schedule F hereto shall be deemed to be
approved by PepsiCo.  For purposes of this Agreement,  the term "A Credit" shall
mean a corporation or banking  association  whose long-term debt obligations are
rated A+ or A1 or better by  Standard &amp; Poor's or by Moody's,  respectively,  or
their successors in interest that are "nationally  recognized statistical rating
organizations."

        (c) TRICON agrees that no member of the TRICON Group shall modify, amend
or extend  (including,  without  limitation,  pursuant to any existing option to
extend)  any of the leases for  property  of the  TRICON  Group  which have been
guaranteed by a member of the PepsiCo Group (including,  without limitation, the
leases  identified on Schedule G hereto)  (collectively,  the "Leases") so as to
increase  or in any  way  enlarge  the  duration  of any of the  obligations  or
liabilities  of any member of the PepsiCo  Group  pursuant  to those  guarantees
without first  obtaining the prior written  approval of PepsiCo,  which approval
may be  withheld  by PepsiCo in its sole  discretion.  TRICON  hereby  agrees to
provide to PepsiCo,  prior to the Distribution  Date, a schedule (the "PHI Lease
Schedule")  listing  each lease for  property of the TRICON Group which has been
guaranteed by Pizza Hut, Inc. The PHI Lease  Schedule shall  supplement,  and be
incorporated by reference into, Schedule G hereto. TRICON further agrees that no
member of the TRICON Group shall default under or breach any of the Leases so as
to cause or give rise to any claims,  actions,  suits or proceedings against any
member of the PepsiCo Group arising out of such guarantees, and hereby agrees to
indemnify  and hold  harmless  each member of the PepsiCo Group from and against
all  such  liabilities,  costs  and  expenses  (including,  without  limitation,
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and any and all  expenses  reasonably  incurred  in
investigating,   preparing  or  defending   against  any  pending  or  seriously
threatened  litigation or claim) associated therewith in accordance with Section
5 hereof. TRICON shall immediately notify PepsiCo, in writing, of any allegation
or claim asserted by any person or entity which might give rise to any liability
or obligation of any member of the PepsiCo Group under any such guarantee.
    

        Section 11.  Insurance.  (a) All policies of liability,  fire,  workers'
compensation  and other  forms of  insurance  maintained  by the  PepsiCo  Group
insuring the products,  properties, assets and/or operations of the TRICON Group
shall continue in full force and effect up to and through the Distribution Date,
and except as set forth on  Schedule  H hereto,  shall be  terminated  effective
11:59:59 p.m. on the  Distribution  Date.  Any refunds of prepaid  premiums with
respect to such  terminated  insurance shall be for PepsiCo's  account.  PepsiCo
shall be responsible  for obtaining such initial  insurance  coverage for TRICON
from and after the  Distribution  Date in such amounts as are agreed upon by the
Parties. TRICON shall be liable for payment of all premiums with respect to such
initial insurance  coverage and all subsequent  coverage which TRICON thereafter
elects to obtain.  For purposes of this  Section,  insurance  coverage  does not
include any insurance for plans  described in the Employee  Programs  Agreement,
but does include ERISA fidelity bonds and/or fiduciary insurance.

   
        (b) With respect to any insurance  programs relating to the TRICON Group
(including,  without limitation,  any casualty insurance programs such as public
and products liability insurance,  insured or self-insured workers' compensation
insurance  and  automobile  liability  insurance),  TRICON  shall be liable  for
payment of all claims  arising out of incidents,  known or unknown,  reported or
unreported,  which  occur  prior  to,  on or after the  Distribution  Date.  Any
reserves under these insurance programs relating to the TRICON Group for periods
ending prior to, on or after the  Distribution  Date shall be for the account of
TRICON. Such reserves shall be included as liabilities of TRICON, and any charge
or credit to the reserves shall be for TRICON's account.
    

        Section 12. Banking and Other Arrangements.  The responsibility for bank
accounts used  exclusively by the TRICON Group shall be transferred from PepsiCo
to  TRICON  on or prior to the  Distribution  Date.  Normal  procedures  will be
followed for receipts and  disbursements  funding prior to the Distribution Date
as set forth on Schedule I hereto.

        Section 13.  Procedures  for  Closing and  Delivery of Books and Balance
Sheet and Payment of Certain Amounts to PepsiCo.  Financial statements of TRICON
as of the Distribution Date, which shall be summaries of the combined accounting
ledgers of the TRICON  Group as of the close of the tenth  accounting  period of
the 1997 fiscal year, and which shall include an Opening Balance Sheet, shall be
prepared by PepsiCo within 45 days after the Distribution  Date and reviewed and
agreed to by TRICON within 15 days after such financial statements are prepared.
Each Party shall bear its own expenses in connection  with the  preparation  and
review  of  such  financial  statements.  PepsiCo  and  TRICON  agree  that  the
principles for determining the Opening Balance Sheet are as follows:

        (a) Total  Assets  shall be  determined  through  the  normal  reporting
process using U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP") as applied
on a basis  substantially  consistent  with the basis used in the preparation of
the financial statements of TRICON presented in the Form 10 and standard PepsiCo
definitions and accounting practice, consistently applied.

        (b) Non-Interest  Bearing  Liabilities  shall be determined  through the
normal  reporting  process  using  GAAP  as  applied  on a  basis  substantially
consistent with the basis used in the preparation of the financial statements of
TRICON presented in the Form 10 and standard PepsiCo  definitions and accounting
practice,  consistently  applied.  Accrued tax  liabilities  shall be treated in
accordance with the provisions of the Tax Agreement.

        (c) Net  Assets is the sum of total  assets  less  non-interest  bearing
liabilities.  Net Assets shall be determined  in  accordance  with the following
capitalization procedure:

   
     (i)  Short and  Long-Term  Debt  shall be  determined  through  the  normal
          reporting  process  using  GAAP as  applied  on a basis  substantially
          consistent  with the basis used in the  preparation  of the  financial
          statements  of TRICON  presented in the Form 10 and  standard  PepsiCo
          definitions and accounting practice, consistently applied. The Opening
          Balance  Sheet will  reflect $4.5  billion of debt  obligations  to be
          incurred by TRICON on or prior to the  Distribution  Date.  All of the
          proceeds of such debt obligations will be transferred to PepsiCo prior
          to the  Distribution  Date as  repayment  of  certain  amounts  due to
          PepsiCo from the TRICON Group and a dividend.
    

     (ii) Stockholders'  Equity of TRICON will equal the difference  between the
          total Net Assets less the Short and Long-Term Debt on TRICON's Opening
          Balance Sheet as of the Distribution Date.

        Any  amounts  due PepsiCo by the TRICON  Group  related to  intercompany
accounts  (other than those  accounts  which are defined as  intercompany  trade
receivables and payables in accordance with PepsiCo financial policies) or other
promissory  notes in excess of the  amount set forth in (i)  immediately  above,
which will cover  repayment  of certain  amounts due to PepsiCo  from the TRICON
Group, will be capitalized by PepsiCo.

        Section 14. Operation Until Closing.  TRICON agrees, on behalf of itself
and each member of the TRICON  Group,  that  through the  Distribution  Date the
Restaurant  Businesses  shall be operated in the  ordinary  course of  business,
consistent with past practice.

        Section  15.  De-Identification.   As  soon  as  practicable  after  the
Distribution  Date, and in no event later than 120 days after such Date,  TRICON
shall eliminate all exterior and interior  signage and other  identification  in
its  possession or control,  and cease using any  letterhead,  which  identifies
TRICON or any other entity  within the TRICON Group as a subsidiary or affiliate
of PepsiCo.

        Section 16. Parties. As used in this Agreement, the term "Parties" shall
include  the  PepsiCo  Group and its  successors,  and the TRICON  Group and its
successors.  Each of PepsiCo  and TRICON  agrees that it shall cause each of its
subsidiaries and affiliates to comply fully with the terms of this Agreement.

        Section  17.  Expenses.  Except as set forth on  Schedule J hereto or as
otherwise  provided  in  this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  the
Schedules  and  Attachments   hereto),  all  expenses  in  connection  with  the
Distribution  shall be borne by PepsiCo and all expenses in connection  with the
ongoing  operations  and/or  businesses  of the TRICON  Group  shall be borne by
TRICON.

        Section  18.  Tax  Gross-Up.  If any  amount  paid by any  member of the
PepsiCo  Group  or the  TRICON  Group,  as the  case  may be,  pursuant  to this
Agreement  results in any  increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax Asset
of the TRICON Group or the PepsiCo Group, respectively,  then PepsiCo or TRICON,
as  appropriate,  shall  indemnify the other Party and hold it harmless from and
against any interest or penalty  attributable to such increased Tax liability or
the reduction of such Tax Asset and shall pay to the other Party, in addition to
amounts  otherwise owed, the After-Tax  Amount.  Capitalized  terms used in this
Section 18 but not otherwise  defined in this Agreement  shall have the meanings
assigned to such terms in the Tax Agreement.

        Section 19.  Survival.  All of the  provisions of this  Agreement  shall
survive the Distribution Date.

        Section 20. Other  Provisions.  This Agreement  shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, may not be
assigned by either  Party  without the written  consent of the other,  and shall
bind and  inure to the  benefit  of the  Parties  hereto  and  their  respective
successors  and  permitted  assignees.   This  Agreement  may  not  be  amended,
supplemented  or otherwise  modified except by an agreement in writing signed by
PepsiCo and TRICON.  This  Agreement  may be executed in  counterparts,  each of
which  shall  be  deemed  to be an  original  and all of  which  together  shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

        Section  21.  Arbitration.  (a)  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in the
attachments  hereto, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement,  or the breach hereof,  shall be settled by arbitration in accordance
with  the  then  prevailing   Commercial   Arbitration  Rules  of  the  American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA") as such rules may be modified herein.

        (b) An award rendered in connection with an arbitration pursuant to this
Section  shall be final  and  binding  and  judgment  upon  such an award may be
entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

        (c) The forum for arbitration under this Section shall be agreed upon by
the Parties, or, failing such agreement, shall be New York, New York.

        (d)  Arbitration  shall be  conducted  by a single  arbitrator  selected
jointly by PepsiCo and TRICON.  If within 30 days after a demand for arbitration
is made,  PepsiCo and TRICON are unable to agree on a single  arbitrator,  three
arbitrators  shall be appointed.  Within 30 days after such  inability to agree,
PepsiCo and TRICON shall each select one  arbitrator  and those two  arbitrators
shall  then  select  a third  arbitrator  unaffiliated  with  either  Party.  In
connection with the selection of the third  arbitrator,  consideration  shall be
given to familiarity with corporate  divestiture  transactions and experience in
dispute resolution between parties, as a judge or otherwise.  If the arbitrators
selected by PepsiCo and TRICON cannot agree on the third arbitrator  within such
30 day period, they shall promptly thereafter discuss the qualifications of such
third  arbitrator  with the AAA prior to  selection  of such  arbitrator,  which
selection  shall be in accordance with the Commercial  Arbitration  Rules of the
AAA.

        (e) If an  arbitrator  cannot  continue  to  serve,  a  successor  to an
arbitrator  selected  by PepsiCo or  TRICON,  as the case may be,  also shall be
selected by the same Party,  and a successor to the neutral  arbitrator shall be
selected as specified in subsection  (d) of this Section.  A full rehearing will
be held only if the neutral  arbitrator is unable to continue to serve or if the
remaining arbitrators unanimously agree that such a rehearing is appropriate.

        (f) The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be guided, but not bound, by the
Federal  Rules of Evidence  and by the  procedural  rules,  including  discovery
provisions,  of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure.  Any  discovery  shall be
limited  to  information  directly  relevant  to the  controversy  or  claim  in
arbitration.

        Section 22. Limitation on Subsequent Activities. PepsiCo agrees, without
any separately  bargained for  consideration,  but rather as an integral part of
the  transfer  of  the  Restaurant  Businesses  to  the  TRICON  Group  and  the
Distribution provided for in this Agreement, that it shall not directly, through
a subsidiary or affiliate, or otherwise,  through October 1, 2000, open anywhere
in the  United  States or Canada a  restaurant  substantially  identical  to the
restaurant  concepts  operated by the TRICON Group at the opening of business on
the day following the Distribution Date. PepsiCo acknowledges that the remedy at
law for any breach of the  foregoing  covenant  would be  inadequate  and in the
event of any such breach TRICON shall be entitled to injunctive relief.

        Section 23. Notices.  Any notice,  demand,  claim or other communication
under this Agreement  shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given
(i) upon the  delivery  thereof  if  delivered  personally  (including,  without
limitation,  by courier),  (ii) three days after being sent by  certified  mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) upon receipt of confirmation
of a  telecopy  transmission,  in each  case  to the  Parties  at the  following

other):

                          RESTAURANT FUNDING STRUCTURE
                         PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION DATE


[Graphic material omitted]  Organizational  chart evidencing  restaurant funding
structure prior to the Distribution Date:

   
Current Funding Structure:

        PepsiCo funds all restaurant  disbursements  and collects all restaurant
sales via the following mechanisms:

        1. Cash is automatically  collected from restaurant  depository accounts
into a Concentration Account for each concept. Money is then moved automatically
to PepsiCo's  Master  Concentration  Account via  PepsiCo's  cash  concentration
system and drawdown wires.

        2. Cash required to fund payroll and accounts  payable  disbursements on
behalf of the  restaurants  is funded by wire  transfer  from  PepsiCo's  Master
Concentration  Account into a PepsiCo Master  Disbursement  Funding Account on a
daily  basis.  The  PepsiCo  Master  Disbursement   Funding  Account  will  then
automatically  fund checks  which have been  written off  restaurant  controlled
disbursement accounts.


Funding Structure Just Prior to Distribution Date (on or about 9/22/97):

        PepsiCo funds all restaurant  disbursements  and collects all restaurant
sales via the following mechanisms:

        1. Cash is automatically  collected from restaurant  depository accounts
into a Concentration Account for each concept. Money is then moved automatically
to TRICON's Master Concentration Account via PepsiCo's cash concentration system
and drawdown  wires and then  automatically  to PepsiCo's  Master  Concentration
Account via zero balance accounts.

        2. Cash required to fund payroll and accounts  payable  disbursements on
behalf  of  the   restaurants  is  moved   automatically   to  TRICON's   Master
Concentration  Account  via zero  balance  accounts  and then is  funded by wire
transfer  from  TRICON's  Master  Concentration  Account  into a  TRICON  Master
Disbursement  Funding Account on a daily basis.  The TRICON Master  Disbursement
Funding Account will then  automatically fund checks which have been written off
restaurant controlled disbursement accounts.


Anticipated Funding Structure Post Distribution Date:

        TRICON funds all  restaurant  disbursements  and collects all restaurant
sales via the following mechanisms:

        1. Cash is automatically  collected from restaurant  depository accounts
into a Concentration Account for each concept. Money is then moved automatically
to TRICON's Master Concentration Account via ACH Debits and drawdown wires.

        2. Cash required to fund payroll and accounts  payable  disbursements on
behalf of the  restaurants  is  funded by wire  transfer  from  TRICON's  Master
Concentration  Account into a TRICON Master  Disbursement  Funding  Account on a
daily  basis.  The  TRICON  Master   Disbursement   Funding  Account  will  then
automatically  fund checks  which have been  written off  restaurant  controlled
disbursement accounts.

                       RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

                                       OF

                         TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc.



        FIRST: The name of the corporation is TRICON Global  Restaurants,  Inc.,
hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation".

        SECOND:  The  Corporation  shall have  authority to issue  1,000,000,000
shares,  without par value, of which 750,000,000 shall be Common Shares,  and of
which 250,000,000  shares shall be Preferred Shares,  with the following powers,
preferences and rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions:

        (a) Except as  otherwise  provided by law,  each Common Share shall have
one  vote,  and,  except as  otherwise  provided  in  respect  of any  series of
Preferred  Shares  hereafter  classified or  reclassified,  the exclusive voting
power for all purposes shall be vested in the holders of the Common  Shares.  In
the event of any  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding  up of the  Corporation,
whether  voluntary  or  involuntary,  the holders of the Common  Shares shall be
entitled,  after  payment  or  provision  for  payment  of the  debts  and other
liabilities of the Corporation and the amount to which the holders of any series
of Preferred Shares hereafter  classified or reclassified having a preference on
distribution  in the  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
shall  be  entitled,  to  share  ratably  in the  remaining  net  assets  of the
Corporation.

        (b) The  Board  of  Directors  is  authorized,  subject  to  limitations
prescribed by the North Carolina  Business  Corporation  Act ("NCBCA") and these
Articles  of  Incorporation,  to adopt and file from  time to time  articles  of
amendment that  authorize the issuance of Preferred  Shares which may be divided
into two or more series with such preferences,  limitations, and relative rights
as the Board of Directors may determine;  provided,  however,  that no holder of
any  Preferred  Share  shall be  authorized  or  entitled  to  receive  upon the
involuntary  liquidation  of the  Corporation an amount in excess of $100.00 per
Preferred Share.

        THIRD:  The address of the registered  office of the  Corporation in the
State of North Carolina is 225 Hillsborough Street,  Raleigh, Wake County, North
Carolina 27603; and the name of its initial  registered agent at such address is
CT Corporation System.

        FOURTH:  No  holder  of any  share of the  Corporation,  whether  now or
hereinafter  authorized,  shall have any preemptive right to subscribe for or to
purchase any shares or other securities of the  Corporation,  nor have any right
to cumulate  his votes for the  election of  Directors.  At all  meetings of the
Shareholders of the Corporation, a quorum being present, all matters (other than
the  election  of  Directors)  shall be decided by the vote of the  holders of a
majority  of the stock of the  Corporation,  present in person or by proxy,  and
entitled to vote thereat.

        FIFTH:  The following  provisions are intended for the management of the
business and for the  regulation  of the affairs of the  Corporation,  and it is
expressly  provided that the same are intended to be in  furtherance  and not in
limitation of the powers conferred by statute:

        (a) The Board of Directors  shall have the exclusive power and authority
to direct  management of the business and affairs of the  Corporation  and shall
exercise  all  corporate  powers,  and  possess  all  authority,   necessary  or
appropriate to carry out the intent of this provision, and which are customarily
exercised by the board of directors of a public  company.  In furtherance of the
foregoing,  but  without  limitation,  the  Board of  Directors  shall  have the
exclusive  power and  authority  to:  (a) elect all  executive  officers  of the
Corporation  as the Board may deem  necessary or desirable from time to time, to
serve at the pleasure of the Board;  (b) fix the  compensation of such officers;
(c) fix the  compensation of Directors;  and (d) determine the time and place of
all meetings of the Board of Directors and  Shareholders of the  Corporation.  A
scheduled  meeting of Shareholders may be postponed by the Board of Directors by
public notice given at or prior to the time of the meeting.

   
        (b) The number of Directors  constituting  the Board of Directors  shall
not be less than three nor more than fifteen,  as may be fixed from time to time
by resolution  duly adopted by the Board of Directors.  Provided that the number
of members of the Board of Directors equals or exceeds the number required under
the NCBCA to stagger  the terms of  Directors,  from and after the first  annual
Shareholders'  meeting,  the Board of  Directors  shall be  divided  into  three
classes,  as nearly  equal in number as may be possible,  to serve  respectively
until the annual meetings in 1998,  1999, and 2000 in the classes  designated by
the shareholder of the  Corporation at the 1997 Annual Meeting,  and until their
successors  shall be elected and shall  qualify,  and  thereafter the successors
shall be elected to serve for terms of three  years and until  their  successors
shall be elected and shall qualify.  In the event of any increase or decrease in
the number of Directors,  the additional or eliminated directorships shall be so
classified  or chosen such that all classes of Directors  shall remain or become
equal in number, as nearly as may be possible.
    

        (c) A vacancy  occurring on the Board of Directors,  including,  without
limitation,  a vacancy  resulting from an increase in the number of Directors or
from the failure by Shareholders of the Corporation to elect the full authorized
number of Directors, may only be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors
or by the  sole  remaining  Director  in  office.  In the  event  of the  death,
resignation,  retirement,  removal or  disqualification of a Director during his
elected term of office,  his successor shall serve until the next  Shareholders'
meeting at which  Directors  are elected.  Directors  may be removed from office
only for cause.

        (d) The Board of Directors may adopt,  amend or repeal the Corporation's
Bylaws, in whole or in part,  including amendment or repeal of any Bylaw adopted
by the Shareholders of the Corporation.

        (e) The  Corporation  may in its Bylaws  confer  upon  Directors  powers
additional to the foregoing and the powers and  authorities  conferred upon them
by statute.

        (f) The  Corporation  reserves  the right to amend,  alter,  change,  or
repeal any provision herein contained, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed
by law, and all the rights  conferred upon  Shareholders  hereunder are granted,
and are to be held and enjoyed, subject to such rights of amendment, alteration,
change or repeal.

        (g) The only  qualifications  for Directors of the Corporation  shall be
those  set  forth in these  Articles  of  Incorporation.  Directors  need not be
residents of the State of North Carolina or Shareholders of the Corporation.

        (h) The Board of Directors  may create and make  appointments  to one or
more committees of the Board  comprised  exclusively of Directors who will serve
at the  pleasure of the Board and who may have and  exercise  such powers of the
Board in directing the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation
as the  Board  may  delegate,  in  its  sole  discretion,  consistent  with  the
provisions  of the NCBCA  and  these  Articles  of  Incorporation.  The Board of
Directors may not delegate its authority  over the  expenditure  of funds of the
Corporation  except  to a  committee  of the  Board  and  except  to one or more
officers of the  Corporation  elected by the Board.  No  committee  comprised of
persons  other than members of the Board of Directors  shall possess or exercise
any authority in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation.

        SIXTH:  (a) The  Corporation  shall,  to the fullest extent from time to
time  permitted  by law,  indemnify  its  Directors  and  officers  against  all
liabilities  and expenses in any suit or proceedings,  whether civil,  criminal,
administrative or  investigative,  and whether or not brought by or on behalf of
the Corporation, including all appeals therefrom, arising our of their status as
such  or  their  activities  in any  of the  foregoing  capacities,  unless  the
activities  of the  person to be  indemnified  were at the time  taken  known or
believed by such  Director  or officer to be clearly in  conflict  with the best
interests of the  Corporation.  The  Corporation  shall likewise and to the same
extent  indemnify any person who, at the request of the  Corporation,  is or was
serving as a Director,  officer,  partner, trustee, employee or agent of another
foreign or domestic  corporation,  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or other
enterprise, or as a trustee or administrator under any employee benefit plan.

        (b)  The  right  to be  indemnified  hereunder  shall  include,  without
limitation, the right of a Director or officer to be paid expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking to repay
such amount unless it shall  ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled
to be indemnified hereunder.

        (c) A person  entitled to  indemnification  hereunder shall also be paid
reasonable  costs,   expenses  and  attorneys'  fees  (including   expenses)  in
connection  with  the  enforcement  of  rights  to the  indemnification  granted
hereunder.

        (d) The foregoing  rights of  indemnification  shall not be exclusive of
any other  rights to which those  seeking  indemnification  may be entitled  and
shall not be limited by the  provisions  of Section  55-8-51 of the NCBCA or any
successor statute.

        (e) The Board of Directors may take such action as it deems necessary or
desirable  to carry out these  indemnification  provisions,  including  adopting
procedures for determining and enforcing the rights  guaranteed  hereunder,  and
the Board of Directors is expressly  empowered to adopt,  approve and amend from
time to time such Bylaws,  resolutions or contracts implementing such provisions
or such further indemnification arrangement as may be permitted by law.

        (f) Neither the amendment or repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of
any provision of these Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article,
shall eliminate or reduce any right to indemnification  afforded by this Article
to any person with respect to their status or any  activities in their  official
capacities prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

        SEVENTH:  To the full  extent  from time to time  permitted  by law,  no
person who is serving or who has served as a Director of the  Corporation  shall
be personally  liable in any action for monetary  damages for breach of any duty
as a  Director,  whether  such  action  is  brought  by or in the  right  of the
Corporation or otherwise.  Neither the amendment or repeal of this Article,  nor
the adoption of any provision of these  Articles of  Incorporation  inconsistent
with this Article,  shall  eliminate or reduce the  protection  afforded by this
Article to a  Director  of the  Corporation  with  respect  to any matter  which
occurred,  or in any cause of action,  suit or claim which but for this  Article
would have accrued or arisen, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

        EIGHTH:  The  provisions  of  Article  9A of  the  NCBCA  shall  not  be
applicable to the Corporation.

        NINTH: Except as may be otherwise  determined by the Board of Directors,
the Shareholders of the Corporation  shall have access as a matter of right only
to the  books and  records  of the  Corporation  as may be  required  to be made
available to qualified shareholders by the NCBCA.

        TENTH: To the extent that there ever may be inconsistency  between these
Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Corporation as may be adopted or
amended from time to time, the Articles of Incorporation shall always control.

                            TAX SEPARATION AGREEMENT


               This  Agreement  is  entered  into as of the [ ] day of [ ], 1997
between PepsiCo,  Inc. ("PepsiCo"),  a North Carolina corporation,  on behalf of
itself and the members of the PepsiCo Group, and TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc.
("TRICON"), a North Carolina corporation, on behalf of itself and the members of
the TRICON Group.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

               WHEREAS,  pursuant  to the  tax  laws of  various  jurisdictions,
certain  members of the TRICON Group,  as defined below,  presently file certain
tax returns on an affiliated,  consolidated,  combined, unitary, fiscal unity or
other  group basis  (including  as  permitted  by Section  1501 of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended  (the  "Code"))  with  certain  members of the
PepsiCo Group, as defined below (each such group, a "Consolidated Group");

               WHEREAS,  PepsiCo  and TRICON  intend to enter into a  Separation
Agreement dated as of [ ], 1997 (the "Separation Agreement"),  providing for the
distribution by PepsiCo to its shareholders of all of the common stock of TRICON
that is held by PepsiCo (the "Distribution") and certain other matters;

   
               WHEREAS,  PepsiCo and TRICON desire to set forth their  agreement
on the rights and obligations of PepsiCo,  TRICON and the members of the PepsiCo
Group and the TRICON  Group,  respectively,  with  respect to the  handling  and
allocation  of  federal,  state,  local and  foreign  Taxes  incurred in Taxable

transactions  effected in  connection  with the  Distribution  including but not
limited to the distribution of certain  borrowing  proceeds by TRICON to PepsiCo
(the "Restructuring") and various other Tax matters;
    

               NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the mutual  covenants and
agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.      Definitions

               (a)    As used in this Agreement:

               "Affiliate"  of  any  Person  shall  mean  (i)  any   individual,
corporation, partnership or other entity directly or indirectly owning more than
50 percent (by vote or value) of,  owned more than 50 percent (by vote or value)
by, or under more than 50 percent (by vote or value) common ownership with, such
Person,  and (ii) any entity that is entitled to the benefit of any Tax Asset of
such Person  under  applicable  law, any entity with any Tax Asset to which such
Person is entitled to the benefit of under  applicable  law, or any entity which
is entitled or required to transfer or assign  income,  revenues,  receipts,  or
gains to such Person under applicable law.

               "After-Tax  Amount" shall mean an additional  amount necessary to
reflect  the  hypothetical  Tax  consequences  of the  receipt or accrual of any
payment, using the maximum statutory rate (or rates, in the case of an item that
affects more than one Tax)  applicable  to the recipient of such payment for the
relevant year,  reflecting for example,  the effect of the deductions  available
for interest paid or accrued and for Taxes such as state and local income Taxes.

               "Consolidated Group" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the
first "whereas" clause in this Agreement;  provided, however, that "Consolidated
Group" shall also include (i) any Affiliate of PepsiCo that filed (or will file)
any  Pre-Distribution   Period  Returns  that  reflect  the  income,  assets  or
operations of a Restaurant  Business and (ii) any Affiliate of TRICON that filed

Agreement shall, to the extent the context  requires,  have the meaning assigned
to it in  the  Code  or  the  applicable  Treasury  regulations  thereunder  (as
interpreted  in  administrative  pronouncements  and judicial  decisions)  or in
comparable provisions of applicable law.

2.      Administrative and Compliance Matters.

               (a) Sole Tax Sharing Agreement.  Any and all existing Tax sharing
agreements  or  arrangements,  written or  unwritten,  between any member of the
PepsiCo  Group and any  member of the TRICON  Group  shall be or shall have been
terminated as of the date of this  Agreement.  As of the date of this Agreement,
neither  the members of the TRICON  Group nor the  members of the PepsiCo  Group
shall have any further  rights or  liabilities  thereunder,  and this  Agreement
shall be the sole Tax sharing  agreement between the members of the TRICON Group
and the members of the PepsiCo Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
termination is not binding on any Taxing Authority,  the TRICON Group shall hold
the affected  member of the PepsiCo Group  harmless  against any adverse  effect
which would have been avoided if such  termination had been given effect by such
Taxing Authority.

               (b)  Designation  of Agent.  TRICON and each member of the TRICON
Group,  and PepsiCo and each member of the PepsiCo Group, as the case may be, in
each case with  respect  to any  Consolidated  Group of which  such  Person is a
member,  hereby irrevocably authorize PepsiCo or TRICON, as the case may be, and
consistent  with past practice and applicable  law, to designate a member of the
PepsiCo  Group or the TRICON  Group,  as  appropriate,  or a  successor  of such
member, as its agent, coordinator, and administrator,  for the purpose of taking
any and all actions  (including the execution of waivers of applicable  statutes
of limitation)  necessary or incidental to the filing of any Return, any amended
Return,  or any claim for refund (even where an item or Tax Asset giving rise to
an amended Return or refund claim arises in a Post-Distribution  Period), credit
or  offset  of Tax or any  other  proceedings,  and for the  purpose  of  making
payments to, or collecting  refunds  from,  any Taxing  Authority,  in each case
relating only to any  Pre-Distribution  Period.  Such  designated  member of the
PepsiCo  Group or the TRICON Group,  as the case may be, as agent,  covenants to
TRICON or PepsiCo,  respectively,  that it shall be  responsible to see that all
such  administrative  matters  relating  thereto  shall be handled  promptly and
appropriately.

               (c)   Pre-Distribution   Period   Returns.   With  respect  to  a
Consolidated  Group,  the member of the PepsiCo  Group or the TRICON  Group,  as
applicable,  that is  required  by  applicable  law to file the  Returns for all
Pre-Distribution  Periods will prepare such Returns with the  assistance  of the
TRICON  Group  or  the  PepsiCo  Group,  respectively.   With  respect  to  each
Consolidated  Group,  either a member  of the  PepsiCo  Group or a member of the
TRICON Group, as consistent with past practice and applicable law, will file the
Pre-Distribution  Period Returns for such  Consolidated  Group.  PepsiCo and the
members  of  the  PepsiCo  Group  shall  have  the  right  with  respect  to any
Consolidated  Group  Returns to determine  (x) the manner in which such returns,
documents  or  statements  shall  be  prepared  and  filed,  including,  without
limitation,  the manner in which any item of income,  gain,  loss,  deduction or
credit shall be reported,  (y) whether any extensions  should be requested,  and
(z) the elections, including claims and surrenders for U.K. group relief and any
similar foreign  offsetting  procedures,  that will be made by any member of the
PepsiCo  Group  or  the  TRICON  Group.   In  addition,   with  respect  to  all
Pre-Distribution  Periods,  except as provided in Section 8(b),  PepsiCo and the
members of the PepsiCo Group shall have the right to (i) contest,  compromise or
settle any adjustment or deficiency  proposed,  asserted or assessed as a result
of any audit of any consolidated return filed by the PepsiCo Group or the TRICON
Group, (ii) file,  prosecute,  compromise or settle any claim for refund,  (iii)
determine  whether any refunds to which the PepsiCo Group may be entitled  shall
be  received  by way of refund or  credited  against  the tax  liability  of the
PepsiCo  Group and (iv)  determine  whether a deposit will be made with a Taxing
Authority  to stop the running of  interest.  With respect to the 1997 Tax year,
TRICON and the members of the TRICON Group shall  prepare and deliver to PepsiCo
all Tax Packages  within 120 days after the  Distribution  Date,  regardless  of
whether the member's Taxable year ends on the Distribution Date.

3.      Tax Sharing.

               (a) General.  For each Taxable period of each Consolidated  Group
during which income, profits, gains, net worth, receipts,  sales, loss or credit
against  Tax of at least one member of each of the TRICON  Group and the PepsiCo
Group are includible in a Return of such Consolidated Group, the TRICON Group or
the PepsiCo Group, as appropriate,  shall pay, as provided in this Section 3, to
the PepsiCo  Group or the TRICON  Group,  respectively,  an amount  equal to the
TRICON Tax  Liability or the PepsiCo Tax  Liability,  as  appropriate,  for such
Taxable period, if any. Any Return filed by an entity described in clause (i) of
the definition of Consolidated Group shall be treated as required to be filed by
the PepsiCo Group and any payment made prior to the Distribution with respect to
such  Return  shall be treated as having  been made by the  PepsiCo  Group.  Any
Return  filed  by an  entity  described  in  clause  (ii) of the  definition  of
Consolidated  Group shall be treated as required to be filed by the TRICON Group
and any payment made prior to the Distribution with respect to such Return shall
be treated as having been made by the TRICON Group.

                (b) Estimated Payments.  Not later than 3 days after a member of
the PepsiCo Group or a member of the TRICON Group,  as the case may be, makes an
estimated Tax payment with respect to a Taxable period of a Consolidated  Group,
whether or not such payment is made prior to the Distribution, the PepsiCo Group
shall (i) in good faith  determine the amount of the TRICON Tax Liability or the
PepsiCo Tax  Liability,  as  appropriate,  pursuant to this  Agreement  and (ii)
deliver a written  statement to TRICON  reflecting the  determination  described
above.  Not later than three days after  receipt of such  statement,  the TRICON
Group  shall pay to the  PepsiCo  Group or the  PepsiCo  Group  shall pay to the
TRICON Group,  as  appropriate,  the amount so  determined  in  accordance  with
Section 9 hereof.

               (c)    Payment of Taxes at Year-End.

               (i) Not later than 5 business days before a member of the PepsiCo
Group or a member of the TRICON Group, as the case may be, is required to file a
Return (after taking  extensions into account) with respect to any  Consolidated
Group for which  payments  are to be made under this  Agreement,  whether or not
such Return is filed prior to the Distribution,  the PepsiCo Group shall deliver
to the TRICON Group a written statement setting forth the difference between (x)
the TRICON Tax Liability or the PepsiCo Tax Liability, as appropriate,  for such
Return,  and (y) the aggregate amount of payments with respect to the TRICON Tax
Liability  or the  PepsiCo Tax  Liability,  as  appropriate,  for such year made
pursuant to Section 3(b).  Not later than the date such Return is required to be
filed,  the TRICON  Group  shall pay to the PepsiCo  Group or the PepsiCo  Group
shall pay to the TRICON Group,  as  appropriate,  in  accordance  with Section 9
hereof, an amount equal to such difference,  if any; provided,  however, that to
the extent such payment is to be made to the TRICON Group and is attributable to
a claim for refund of Taxes previously paid to a Taxing  Authority,  the PepsiCo
Group will not be required to make such payment to the TRICON Group.

               (ii) With respect to each Return  described in Section 3(a) above
and  previously  filed by a  Consolidated  Group,  and for which the  TRICON Tax
Liability  or the  PepsiCo  Tax  Liability,  as the  case  may be,  has not been
satisfied in full or for which the TRICON  Group has not paid the PepsiCo  Group
in full for a benefit  derived from the use of a Tax Asset of the PepsiCo Group,
the TRICON Group shall pay to the PepsiCo  Group or the PepsiCo  Group shall pay
to the TRICON Group,  as  appropriate,  within 30 days of demand  therefor,  the
amount in respect of such Return as  determined  by the PepsiCo Vice  President,
Tax.

               (d) Certain Other Matters.

               (i) With  respect to each  Consolidated  Group,  the TRICON Group
shall pay to the PepsiCo Group the actual benefit received by such  Consolidated
Group  from the use of any Tax  Asset  of the  PepsiCo  Group  or any Tax  Asset
attributable  to the  Restaurant  Business  which  is  reattributed  to  PepsiCo
pursuant to Treasury Regulation  ss.1.1502-20(g) or any comparable  provision of
applicable   law,   whether   arising   in  a   Pre-Distribution   Period  or  a
Post-Distribution  Period.  Such benefit shall be considered equal to the excess
of the amount of Tax that would have been payable to a Taxing  Authority  (or of
the Tax refund that would have been  receivable) by such  Consolidated  Group in
the  absence  of such Tax Asset  over the  amount of Tax  actually  payable to a
Taxing Authority (or of the Tax refund actually receivable) by such Consolidated
Group. Payment of the amount of such benefit shall be made within 30 days of the
receipt by any member of the TRICON Group of any refund,  credit or other offset
attributable  thereto from the relevant Taxing  Authority and the future Returns
of the PepsiCo Group shall be adjusted to reflect such use.

               (ii) If,  subsequent  to the  payment by the TRICON  Group to the
PepsiCo Group of any amount referred to in Section 3(d)(i) above, there shall be
(A) a Final  Determination which results in a disallowance or a reduction of the
Tax Asset so used or (B) a reduction  in the amount of the  benefit  realized by
the TRICON Group from such Tax Asset as a result of a Final Determination or the
use by the  TRICON  Group of a Tax Asset of a member of the  TRICON  Group,  the
PepsiCo  Group shall repay to the TRICON  Group the amount  which would not have
been payable to the PepsiCo Group pursuant to Section  3(d)(i) had the amount of
the benefit been  determined  in light of such event.  In addition,  the PepsiCo
Group shall hold each  member of the TRICON  Group  harmless  for any penalty or
interest payable by any member of the TRICON Group as a result of any such event
referred to in the preceding sentence,  unless such event is attributable to any
action of any member of the TRICON Group. Any amounts payable under this Section
3(d)(ii)  shall be paid by the  PepsiCo  Group  within 30 days after  receipt of
written notice from the TRICON Group.

               (e)  Treatment of Adjustments.

               (i) Except as provided in clause (iii) below if any adjustment is
made in, or if a Taxing  Authority  assesses any  deficiency  with respect to, a
Return of a Consolidated Group filed by a member of the TRICON Group which would
have increased the PepsiCo Tax Liability under Section  3(c)(i),  then within 30
days after a Final Determination of the adjustment,  the PepsiCo Group shall pay
to the TRICON  Group the  difference  between all payments  actually  made under
Section 3(c)(i) and all payments that would have been made under Section 3(c)(i)
taking such adjustment into account.

               (ii) If any  adjustment  is made  in,  or if a  Taxing  Authority
assesses any deficiency with respect to, a Return of a Consolidated  Group filed
by a member of the  PepsiCo  Group  which  would have  increased  the TRICON Tax
Liability  under  Section  3(c)(i),  then within 30 days after any member of the
PepsiCo  Group makes a payment to a Taxing  Authority  or makes a deposit with a
Taxing  Authority  to  stop  the  running  of  interest  with  respect  to  such
adjustment,  the TRICON  Group  shall pay to the  PepsiCo  Group the  difference
between all payments  actually made under Section  3(c)(i) and all payments that
would have been made under Section 3(c)(i) taking such adjustment into account.

               (iii) If any adjustment made in, or any deficiency  assessed with
respect  to, a Return of a  Consolidated  Group  results in a  reduction  in the
amount of the  benefit  realized  by the  PepsiCo  Group from a Tax Asset of the
TRICON  Group  (whether  or not the  TRICON  Group was paid in  respect  of such
benefit), the TRICON Group shall, within 30 days after receipt of written notice
from the PepsiCo Group,  pay to the PepsiCo Group the amount of such  reduction.
In  addition,  the TRICON  Group  shall hold each  member of the  PepsiCo  Group
harmless  for any penalty or interest  payable by any member of the TRICON Group
as a result of any such reduction.

               (iv) Any  refunds  or  credits  of Tax  (including  a return of a
deposit described in Section 3(e)(ii))  received by a member of the TRICON Group
relating  to a  Pre-Distribution  Period,  shall be paid by such  member  of the
TRICON Group to the PepsiCo  Group within 30 days of receipt;  provided  that no
such  payment  shall  be  required  to the  extent  such  refund  or  credit  is
attributable  to (x) a Tax Asset of the  PepsiCo  Group for  which  payment  has
previously been made by the TRICON Group, or (y) an adjustment for which payment
in respect  thereof has  previously  been made  pursuant  to Section  3(e)(i) or
3(e)(ii).

4.      Certain Representations and Covenants.

   
               (a) (i) TRICON  Representations.  TRICON  and each  member of the
TRICON Group  represent  that as of the date hereof,  and covenants  that on the
Distribution  Date,  there is no plan or intention (A) to liquidate TRICON or to
merge or  consolidate  TRICON,  or any member of the TRICON Group  conducting an
active trade or business relied upon in connection with the Restructuring or the
Distribution, with any other person subsequent to the Distribution, (B) to sell,
refranchise or otherwise  dispose of any asset, or close any restaurant unit, of
TRICON or any member of the TRICON Group  subsequent to the  Distribution,  in a
manner that would result in any  increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax
Asset  of the  PepsiCo  Group or any  member  thereof,  (C) to take  any  action
inconsistent  with the information and  representations  furnished to the IRS or
any other Taxing  Authority in connection  with the request for a private letter
ruling (or any comparable  pronouncement  by a Taxing Authority under applicable
law) with  respect  to the  Distribution  or the  Restructuring,  regardless  of
whether such  information  and  representations  were  included in the ruling or
pronouncement issued by the IRS or other Taxing Authority, (D) to enter into any
negotiations, agreements, or arrangements with respect to transactions or events
(including  stock  issuances,  pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise,
option grants,  capital  contributions,  or acquisitions,  but not including the
Distribution) which, if treated as consummated before the proposed distribution,
would  result in PepsiCo not having  "control"  of TRICON  within the meaning of
sections  355(a)(1)(A)  and 368(c) of the Code at the time of the  Distribution,
(E) to make any  change in equity  structure  that would  result in PepsiCo  not
having such "control" (except for the Distribution),  (F) to repurchase stock of
TRICON in a manner contrary to the requirements of Revenue Procedure 96-30 or in
a manner contrary to the representations made in connection with the request for
a private letter ruling with respect to the Distribution, (G) to take any action
that contravenes any existing gain recognition agreement or other agreement with
a Taxing  Authority to which any member of the TRICON Group or the PepsiCo Group
is a party or (H) to enter into any  negotiations,  agreements,  or arrangements
with respect to transactions or events  (including stock issuances,  pursuant to
the exercise of options or otherwise,  option grants, capital contributions,  or
acquisitions,   but  not  including  the  Distribution)   which  may  cause  the
Distribution  to be  treated  as part of a plan  pursuant  to which  one or more

and the  members  of the  TRICON  Group  and the  PepsiCo  Group,  respectively,
represents  that as of the date hereof,  and covenants that on the  Distribution

can be expected.

   
               (b) TRICON Covenants.  TRICON covenants to PepsiCo that,  without
the prior  written  consent of the PepsiCo Vice  President,  Tax, (i) during the
two-year period following the Distribution  Date neither TRICON,  nor any member
of the TRICON  Group  conducting  an active  trade or  business  relied  upon in
connection with the Restructuring or the Distribution,  will liquidate, merge or
consolidate with any other person, (ii) during the two-year period following the
Distribution  Date TRICON will not sell,  refranchise  exchange,  distribute  or
otherwise  dispose of its assets or those of any member of the TRICON Group,  or

a manner that would result in any  increased  Tax  liability or reduction of any
Tax Asset of the  PepsiCo  Group or any  member  thereof,  (iii)  following  the
Distribution,  TRICON  will,  for a minimum  of two years,  continue  the active
conduct of the historic  business  conducted by TRICON  throughout the five year
period prior to the Distribution,  (iv) during the two-year period following the
Distribution Date TRICON will not enter into any transaction affecting,  or that
could  affect,  the  ownership of the equity  interests  in TRICON,  or make any
change in its equity  structure  (including  stock  issuances,  pursuant  to the
exercise  of  options  or  otherwise,   option  grants,   the  adoption  of,  or
authorization of shares under, a stock option plan,  capital  contributions,  or
acquisitions, but not including the Distribution), (v) TRICON will not, nor will
it permit any member of the TRICON Group to, take any action  inconsistent  with
the  information  and  representations  furnished to the IRS or any other Taxing
Authority in  connection  with the request for a private  letter  ruling (or any
comparable  pronouncement  by a Taxing  Authority  under  applicable  law)  with
respect to the  Distribution  or the  Restructuring,  regardless of whether such
information  and  representations  were included in the ruling or  pronouncement
issued  by the IRS or other  Taxing  Authority,  (vi)  TRICON  will not take any
action  that  contravenes  any  existing  gain  recognition  agreement  or other
agreement with a Taxing Authority to which any member of the TRICON Group or the
PepsiCo Group is a party,  (vii) TRICON will not repurchase stock of TRICON in a
manner contrary to the  requirements  of Revenue  Procedure 96-30 or in a manner
contrary  to the  representations  made in  connection  with the  request  for a
private letter ruling with respect to the  Distribution,  (viii) on or after the
Distribution  Date TRICON will not,  nor will it permit any member of the TRICON
Group to, make or change any accounting method, amend any Return or take any Tax
position on any Return,  take any other action, omit to take any action or enter
into any transaction that results in any increased Tax liability or reduction of
any Tax Asset of the  PepsiCo  Group or any  member  thereof  in  respect of any
Pre-Distribution  Period,  and (ix)  during the  applicable  period  provided in
Section  355(e)(2)(B) of the Code with respect to the Distribution,  it will not
enter into any transaction or make any change equity structure  (including stock
issuances,  pursuant to the  exercise of options,  option  grants or  otherwise,
capital  contributions,  or  acquisitions,  but not including the  Distribution)
which may cause the  Distribution  to be treated as part of a plan  pursuant  to
which  one  or  more  Persons  acquire  directly  or  indirectly   TRICON  stock
representing  a "50-percent or greater  interest"  within the meaning of Section
355(d)(4) of the Code.  TRICON  agrees that PepsiCo is to have no liability  for
any tax  resulting  from any action  referred to in the  preceding  sentence and
agrees to indemnify  and hold  harmless the PepsiCo  Group against any such tax.
TRICON  shall  also  bear all costs  incurred  by  PepsiCo  in  connection  with
PepsiCo's  determination of whether or not to grant any written consent required
under this Section 4(b). In no event will TRICON enter into any  transaction  or
make any change in equity structure (including stock issuances,  pursuant to the
exercise of options or  otherwise,  option  grants,  capital  contributions,  or
acquisitions,  but not  including the  Distribution)  during the two year period
following  the  Distribution   which,  if  treated  as  consummated  before  the
Distribution,  result in  PepsiCo  not  having  "control"  of TRICON  within the
meaning  of  Sections  355(a)(a)(A)  and  368(c)  of the  Code  at the  time  of
Distributtion.  For purposes of the preceding  sentence,  any option  authorized
under a stock option plan will be treated as having been  granted.  TRICON shall
provide to PepsiCo,  on the first  business  day of every month,  commencing  on
November 3, 1997, a certificate  describing any  transaction or change in equity
structure  described in clause (iv) above which  occurred  during the  preceding
month.

               (c) Deductions and Certain Taxes Related to Options.  The PepsiCo
Vice  President,  Tax shall  determine  whether the PepsiCo  Group or the TRICON
Group shall file Returns  claiming (x) the Tax  deductions  attributable  to the
exercise of options to purchase  stock of PepsiCo which are held by employees or
former  employees  of the TRICON  Group and (y) any other  similar  compensation
related Tax  deductions.  If it is determined that the PepsiCo Group shall claim
all such Tax deductions, (i) the PepsiCo Group shall be entitled to any such Tax
Deductions,  (ii) the  Returns of the PepsiCo  Group and the TRICON  Group shall
reflect the  entitlement of the PepsiCo Group to such  deductions,  (iii) to the
extent any such  deductions  are  disallowed,  the TRICON Group shall pay to the
PepsiCo  Group an amount equal to the Tax paid by the PepsiCo  Group as a result
of such  disallowance,  (iv)within 1 day of the exercise of any option described
in clause (x) of the  preceding  sentence,  and within 1 day of any other  event
that would result in a compensation  related Tax deduction,  as the case may be,
the TRICON Group will pay to the PepsiCo  Group an amount equal to the liability
of the PepsiCo Group under the Federal Insurance  Contributions Act, the Federal
Unemployment  Tax Act or any state  employment  tax law in  connection  with the
exercise of such an option,  except to the extent  such Tax is  withheld  from a
payment to the  employee and  remitted to a Taxing  Authority on the  employee's
behalf.  If it is  determined  that the TRICON  Group  shall  claim all such Tax
deductions,  (i) the  Returns of the  PepsiCo  Group and the TRICON  Group shall
reflect such determination, (ii) within 1 day of the exercise of any such option
or the occurrence of any other event that would result in a compensation related
Tax  deduction,  as the case may be, the TRICON  Group  shall pay to the PepsiCo
Group an amount equal to the product of the amount of the related  deduction and
the PepsiCo  Group's  effective  Tax rate for the relevant  Taxable  period,  as
determined by the PepsiCo Vice  President,  Tax, (iii) TRICON and each member of
the TRICON Group will  indemnify  the PepsiCo Group against any Tax liability of
the PepsiCo Group under the Federal  Insurance  Contributions Act or the Federal
Unemployment  Tax Act incurred in connection with the exercise of such an option
or the  occurrence of any other event  resulting in a  compensation  related Tax
deduction,  as the case may be, except to the extent such Tax is withheld from a
payment to the  employee and  remitted to a Taxing  Authority on the  employee's
behalf, and (iv) to the extent such deduction is disallowed,  and if the PepsiCo
Vice  President,  Tax  determines  that the PepsiCo Group should file an amended
Return claiming such deduction,  the PepsiCo Group shall pay to the TRICON Group
the actual benefit  received by the PepsiCo Group in respect of such  deduction.
For purposes of the immediately  preceding  clause (iii),  such benefit shall be
considered equal to the excess of the amount of Tax that would have been payable
to a Taxing  Authority (or of the Tax refund that would have been receivable) by
the  PepsiCo  Group in the  absence  of such  deduction  over the  amount of Tax
actually  payable  to  a  Taxing  Authority  (or  of  the  Tax  refund  actually
receivable) by the PepsiCo Group. Payment of the amount of such benefit shall be
made  within 30 days of the  receipt by any member of the  PepsiCo  Group of any
refund,  credit or other offset  attributable  thereto from the relevant  Taxing
Authority.
    
5.      Indemnities.


               (a) TRICON Indemnity.  TRICON and each member of the TRICON Group
will  jointly  and  severally  indemnify  PepsiCo and the members of the PepsiCo
Group  that were  members of a  Consolidated  Group that  included  such  TRICON
Affiliate against and hold them harmless from:

               (i)  any Tax liability of the TRICON Group and any Tax
liability attributable to the Restructuring;

               (ii) any liability or damage resulting from a breach by TRICON or
any member of the TRICON Group of any  representation or covenant made by TRICON
herein;

   
               (iii)  any Tax  liability  resulting  from the  Distribution  and
attributable to any action of TRICON or any member of the TRICON Group,  without
regard to whether the PepsiCo Vice President, Tax has consented to such action;
    

               (iv) any Tax liability resulting from the recapture,  pursuant to
Section  904(f) of the Code, of an overall  foreign loss for a  Pre-Distribution
Period to the extent that the PepsiCo Vice  President,  Tax determines that such
loss  is   attributable   to  operations  of  the   Restaurant   Business  in  a
Pre-Distribution Period; and

               (v)  all  liabilities,   costs,   expenses  (including,   without
limitation,  reasonable  expenses  of  investigation  and  attorneys'  fees  and
expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of
or incident to the  imposition,  assessment or assertion of any Tax liability or
damage  described in (i), (ii),  (iii),  or (iv) including those incurred in the
contest in good faith in  appropriate  proceedings  relating to the  imposition,
assessment or assertion of any such Tax, liability or damage.

               (b)  PepsiCo  Indemnity.  PepsiCo  and each member of the PepsiCo
Group will jointly and severally  indemnify TRICON and the members of the TRICON
Group that were  members of a  Consolidated  Group that  included  such  PepsiCo
Affiliate against and hold them harmless from:

               (i) any Tax  Liability of the PepsiCo Group and any Tax liability
resulting from the  Distribution,  other than any such liabilities  described in
Section 5(a);

               (ii) any liability or damage  resulting  from a breach by PepsiCo
or any member of the PepsiCo  Group of any  representation  or covenant  made by
PepsiCo herein; and

               (iii)  all  liabilities,   costs,  expenses  (including,  without
limitation,  reasonable  expenses  of  investigation  and  attorneys'  fees  and
expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of
or incident to the  imposition,  assessment or assertion of any Tax liability or
damage  described in (i) or (ii) including those incurred in the contest in good
faith in  appropriate  proceedings  relating to the  imposition,  assessment  or
assertion of any such Tax, liability or damage.

If a member of the  PepsiCo  Group  ceases to be an  Affiliate  of  PepsiCo as a
result of a sale of its stock to a third party (whether or not treated as a sale
or exchange of stock for Tax  purposes),  such member of the PepsiCo Group shall
be released from its obligations under this Agreement upon such sale and neither
PepsiCo  nor any  member of the  PepsiCo  Group  shall  have any  obligation  to
indemnify  TRICON or any member of the TRICON Group under Section  5(b)(iii) for
any liability or damage  attributable  to actions taken by such Affiliate  after
such sale.

               (c)  Discharge of Indemnity.  TRICON,  PepsiCo and the members of
the  TRICON  Group  and  PepsiCo  Group,  respectively,  shall  discharge  their
obligations  under  Sections 5(a) and 5(b) hereof,  respectively,  by paying the
relevant  amount within 30 days of demand  therefor.  The PepsiCo Group shall be
entitled to make such a demand at any time after a member of the  PepsiCo  Group
makes a payment  or  deposit  in  respect  of a Tax for which any  member of the
TRICON Group has an obligation  under  Section  5(a).  The TRICON Group shall be
entitled  to make such a demand at any time  after a Final  Determination  of an
obligation  of any member of the PepsiCo  Group  under  Section  5(b).  Any such
demand shall  include a statement  showing the amount due under  Section 5(a) or
5(b), as the case may be.  Calculation  mechanics relating to items described in
Section 5(a)(i) and 5(b)(i) are set forth in Section 3(c).  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  if either  TRICON,  PepsiCo  or any  member of the  TRICON  Group or
PepsiCo  Group  disputes in good faith the fact or the amount of its  obligation
under  Section  5(a) or Section  5(b),  then no payment of the amount in dispute
shall be required  until any such good faith  dispute is resolved in  accordance
with Section 16 hereof;  provided,  however,  that any amount not paid within 30
days of demand therefor shall bear interest as provided in Section 9.

               (d) Tax Benefits. If an indemnification  obligation of any member
of the  PepsiCo  Group or any  member of the TRICON  Group,  as the case may be,
under this Section 5 with respect to a  Consolidated  Group arises in respect of
an adjustment  that makes  allowable to a member of the TRICON Group or a member
of the PepsiCo Group, respectively, any deduction, amortization,  exclusion from
income or other  allowance  (a "Tax  Benefit")  which  would  not,  but for such
adjustment, be allowable, then any payment by any member of the PepsiCo Group or
any member of the TRICON Group,  respectively,  pursuant to this Section 5 shall
be an amount equal to (x) the amount  otherwise due but for this subsection (d),
minus (y) the present value of the product of the Tax Benefit  multiplied (i) by
the maximum applicable federal,  foreign or state, as the case may be, corporate
tax rate in effect at the time such Tax Benefit becomes allowable to a member of
the TRICON  Group or a member of the PepsiCo  Group (as the case may be) or (ii)
in the case of a credit, by 100 percent. The present value of such product shall
be determined by discounting  such product from the time the Tax Benefit becomes
allowable at a rate equal to Prime.

               (e) For purposes of this Section 5, in the case of Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic  basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but
does not end on) the  Distribution  Date, the portion of such Tax related to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Distribution Date shall (x) in the case
of any Taxes  other than Taxes  based  upon or related to income,  sales,  gross
receipts, wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period  multiplied  by a fraction  the  numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period  ending on the  Distribution  Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and
(y) in the  case of any Tax  based  upon or  related  to  income,  sales,  gross
receipts, wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be deemed equal to the amount
which  would be payable if the  relevant  Tax period  ended on the  Distribution
Date.

6.      Guarantees.  PepsiCo or TRICON, as the case may be, shall guarantee the
obligations of each member of the PepsiCo Group or the TRICON Group,
respectively, under this Agreement.

7.      Communication and Cooperation.

               (a) Consult and  Cooperate.  TRICON and PepsiCo shall consult and
cooperate (and shall cause each member of the TRICON Group or the PepsiCo Group,
respectively,  to  cooperate)  fully at such time and to the  extent  reasonably
requested  by the other party in  connection  with all  matters  subject to this
Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation,

               (i) the retention and provision on reasonable  request of any and
        all information  including all books,  records,  documentation  or other
        information  pertaining to Tax matters relating to the PepsiCo Group and
        the TRICON Group, any necessary explanations of information,  and access
        to  personnel,  until one year after the  expiration  of the  applicable
        statute  of  limitation  (giving  effect to any  extension,  waiver,  or
        mitigation thereof);

               (ii) the  execution  of any  document  that may be  necessary  or
        helpful in connection with any required Return or in connection with any
        audit, proceeding, suit or action; and

               (iii)  the  use  of the  parties'  best  efforts  to  obtain  any
        documentation from a governmental authority or a third party that may be
        necessary or helpful in connection with the foregoing.

               (b)  Provide Information.  PepsiCo and TRICON shall keep each
other fully informed with respect to any material development relating to the
matters subject to this Agreement.

               (c) Tax  Attribute  Matters.  PepsiCo and TRICON  shall  promptly
advise each other with  respect to any proposed  Tax  adjustments  relating to a
Consolidated  Group, which are the subject of an audit or investigation,  or are
the  subject  of any  proceeding  or  litigation,  and which may  affect any Tax
liability or any Tax attribute of PepsiCo, TRICON, the PepsiCo Group, the TRICON
Group or any member of the TRICON Group or the PepsiCo Group (including, but not
limited to, basis in an asset or the amount of earnings and profits).

8.      Audits and Contest.

                (a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
PepsiCo  shall have full control over all matters  relating to any Return or any
Tax Proceeding relating to any Tax matters of at least one member of the PepsiCo
Group.  Except  as  provided  in  Section  8(b),  PepsiCo  shall  have  absolute
discretion with respect to any decisions to be made, or the nature of any action
to be taken, with respect to any matter described in the preceding sentence.

   
               (b)(i) No settlement of any Tax Proceeding relating to any matter
which  would cause a payment  obligation  under  Sections  5(a) or 5(b) shall be
accepted  or  entered  into by or on behalf of the party  entitled  to receive a
payment under either Section 5(a) or 5(b),  whichever is applicable,  unless the
party ultimately responsible for such payment under either Section 5(a) or 5(b),
whichever is applicable (the  "Indemnitor"),  consents thereto in writing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that,
notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  PepsiCo may settle
any Tax  Proceeding if it determines,  in its sole judgment,  that TRICON is not
cooperating in such Tax  Proceeding.  If the Indemnitor  does not respond to the
indemnified  party's  request for consent within 30 days, the Indemnitor will be
deemed to have consented to the settlement.

               (ii)  Upon  request,  during  the  course  of any Tax  Proceeding
relating to a Tax liability or damage  described in Section  5(a),  TRICON shall
from time to time  furnish  PepsiCo with  evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to
PepsiCo  of  TRICON's  ability  to pay the  amount  for which it is  responsible
pursuant to Sectioin  5(a).  If at any time during such Tax  Proceeding  PepsiCo
determines that TRICON could not pay such amount,  then TRICON shall be required
to furnish a guarantee or performance bond  satisfactory to PepsiCo in an amount
equal to the amount for which TRICON is responsible  pursuant to Secton 5(a). If
TRICON  fails to furnish  such  guarantee  or bond,  PepsiCo  may settle the Tax
proceeding  without  TRICON's  consent,  and TRICON  shall  remain  obligated to
indemnify PepsiCo pursuant to Section 5(a).
    

               (c) The indemnified party agrees to give notice to the Indemnitor
of the  assertion  of any  claim,  or the  commencement  of any suit,  action or
proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought  hereunder within 30 days
of such  assertion  or  commencement,  or such earlier time that would allow the
Indemnitor to timely respond to such claim, suit action or proceeding.

               (d) With respect to Returns relating to Taxes solely attributable
to the TRICON Group,  TRICON and the members of the TRICON Group shall have full
control over all matters relating to any Tax Proceeding in connection therewith.
TRICON and the members of the TRICON Group shall have absolute  discretion  with
respect to any  decisions  to be made,  or the nature of any action to be taken,
with respect to any matter described in the preceding sentence.

9.  Payments.  All payments to be made  hereunder  shall be made in  immediately
available funds. Except as otherwise provided,  all payments required to be made
pursuant  to this  Agreement  will be due 30 days after the receipt of notice of
such  payment  or,  where no notice is  required,  30 days  after the  fixing of
liability or the  resolution  of a dispute.  Payments  shall be deemed made when
received.  Any payment that is not made by the PepsiCo Group when due shall bear
interest at LIBOR minus 10 basis points,  as quoted from time to time,  for each
day until paid.  Any payment that is not made by the TRICON Group when due shall
bear  interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points,  as quoted from time to time,  for
each day until paid. If, pursuant to a Final  Determination,  any amount paid by
PepsiCo or the  members  of the  PepsiCo  Group or TRICON or the  members of the
TRICON  Group,  as the case may be,  pursuant to this  Agreement  results in any
increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax Asset of TRICON or any member of
the TRICON  Group or PepsiCo or any member of the PepsiCo  Group,  respectively,
then PepsiCo or TRICON, as appropriate, shall indemnify the other party and hold
it harmless  from any interest or penalty  attributable  to such  increased  Tax
liability  or the  reduction of such Tax Asset and shall pay to the other party,
in addition to amounts otherwise owed, the After-Tax Amount. With respect to any
payment  required to be made under this  Agreement,  the PepsiCo Vice President,
Tax has the right to designate, by written notice to TRICON, which member of the
TRICON Group or the PepsiCo Group, as the case may be, will make or receive such
payment and in which currency such payment will be made.

10.  Notices.  Any notice,  demand,  claim,  or other  communication  under this
Agreement  shall be in  writing  and shall be deemed to have been given upon the
delivery or mailing thereof, as the case may be, if delivered personally or sent
by certified mail, return receipt requested,  postage prepaid, to the parties at
the  following  addresses  (or at such other  address as a party may  specify by

to,  reasonable  attorney fees,  accountant fees and other related  professional

attributable to filing any Return that reflects the income, assets or operations

allocable portion of such costs as provided in Section 5.

12.  Effectiveness;  Termination  and  Survival.  This  Agreement  shall  become
effective upon the consummation of the Distribution.  All rights and obligations
arising  hereunder with respect to a  Pre-Distribution  Tax Period shall survive
until they are fully  effectuated  or performed  and,  provided,  further,  that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall
remain in effect and its  provisions  shall  survive for one year after the full
period of all applicable statutes of limitation (giving effect to any extension,
waiver or mitigation thereof) and, with respect to any claim hereunder initiated
prior  to the end of such  period,  until  such  claim  has  been  satisfied  or
otherwise resolved.

of the Distribution  Date) shall, as of Immediately after the Distribution Date,
receive full recognition,  credit,  and validity and be taken into account under
such TRICON Plan to the same extent as if such items  occurred under such TRICON
Plan,  except to the extent that  duplication  of  benefits  would  result.  The
provisions  of this  Agreement  for the transfer of assets from  certain  trusts
relating to PepsiCo Plans (including Foreign Plans) to the corresponding  trusts
relating  to  TRICON  Plans  (including   Foreign  Plans)  are  based  upon  the
understanding  of the  parties  that  each such  TRICON  Plan  will  assume  all
Liabilities  of the  corresponding  PepsiCo  Plan to or relating to  Transferred
Individuals,   as  provided  for  herein.  If  there  are  any  legal  or  other
authoritative  reasons that any such Liabilities are not effectively  assumed by
the appropriate  TRICON Plan, then the amount of assets transferred to the trust
relating  to such  TRICON  Plan from the  trust  relating  to the  corresponding
PepsiCo Plan shall be recomputed,  ab initio, as set forth below but taking into
account the retention of such Liabilities by such PepsiCo Plan, and assets shall
be  transferred  by the trust relating to such TRICON Plan to the trust relating
to such  PepsiCo  Plan so as to place each such trust in the  position  it would
have been in, had the initial asset  transfer been made in accordance  with such
recomputed amount of assets.

 2.5     RESTRICTION ON PLAN AMENDMENTS

        During the Transition Period, neither PepsiCo nor TRICON shall adopt any
amendment,  or allow any  amendment  to be adopted,  to any of their  respective
Pension  Plans or Savings  Plans that,  in the opinion of counsel  acceptable to
both PepsiCo and TRICON,  would violate Code Sec. 411(d)(6) or that would create
an  optional  form  of  benefit  subject  to Code  Sec.  411(d)(6).  During  the
Transition  Period,  TRICON shall not eliminate any investment  option available
under the TRICON Savings Plan as of Immediately after the Distribution Date.

                              DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS


 3.1     ESTABLISHMENT OF MIRROR PENSION TRUSTS

        Effective   Immediately  after  the  Distribution   Date,  TRICON  shall
establish,  or cause to be  established,  the TRICON Master Trust which shall be
qualified  under  Code  Sec.  401(a),  exempt  from  taxation  under  Code  Sec.
501(a)(1), and forming part of the TRICON Pension Plan and the Pizza Hut Pension
Plan.

 3.2     PIZZA HUT PENSION PLANS

        TRICON shall continue to be responsible for all Liabilities  relating to
the  Pizza  Hut  Pension  Plan.  Effective  no  later  than  the  Close  of  the
Distribution  Date,  TRICON  shall  substitute  itself or another  member of the
TRICON Group for PepsiCo as the plan sponsor and  administrator of the Pizza Hut
Pension Plan.

 3.3    ASSUMPTION OF PENSION PLAN AND PENSION EQUALIZATION PLAN LIABILITIES AND
 ALLOCATION OF INTERESTS IN THE PEPSICO PENSION TRUST

        (a)     Assumption of Liabilities by TRICON Pension Plan

        Immediately  after the Distribution  Date all Liabilities to or relating
to  Transferred  Individuals  under the  PepsiCo  Pension  Plan and the  PepsiCo
Pension  Equalization  Plan shall cease to be Liabilities of the PepsiCo Pension
Plan and the PepsiCo  Pension  Equalization  Plan, as  applicable,  and shall be
assumed in full and in all  respects by the TRICON  Pension  Plan and the TRICON
Pension Equalization Plan, respectively.

        (b)     Asset Allocations and Transfers

               (1)     Calculation of Pension Plan Asset Allocation

                    (A)  As  soon  as   practicable   after  the  Close  of  the
Distribution Date, PepsiCo shall cause to be calculated the 414(l)(1) Amount for
the  PepsiCo  Pension  Plan and the TRICON  Pension  Plan as of the Close of the
Distribution  Date. The assumptions used in determining the 414(l)(1) Amount for
each Pension Plan shall be as follows:

                    (i) As if each plan were  terminating as of the Close of the
               Distribution  Date and with 100% of  participants  who are active
               employees,  employees  on leave of absence,  or former  employees
               with rights to a future  deferred vested pension assumed to elect
               a lump  sum  distribution  of the  value of the  pension  benefit
               accrued as of the Close of the Distribution Date.

                    (ii) For purposes of calculating the lump sum present value,
               mortality rates shall be based on the applicable  mortality table
               under Code Sec.  417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I)  as specified  in Rev.  Rul.
               95-6 and interest calculated based on the annual rate of interest
               on 30-year Treasury securities for the second month preceding the
               month of the Close of the Distribution Date.

                    (iii) For retired participants or former employees receiving
               benefits as of the Close of the  Distribution  Date, the lump sum
               present value of the form of benefit  currently  elected shall be
               valued in the same  manner and using the same  assumptions  as in
               (i) and (ii) above.  For active  participants who are eligible to
               retire as of the  Close of the  Distribution  Date,  the lump sum
               benefit  shall be based on the  accrued  benefit  payable  at the
               current age reflecting  appropriate  early retirement  reductions
               under the plan. For all other participants, the lump sum value is
               the present  value of the accrued  benefit  commencing  at normal
               retirement  age. Early  retirement  subsidies shall be considered
               only for those participants who are retired or eligible to retire
               as of the Close of the Distribution Date.

                    (B) If the  aggregate  amount of the  assets of the  PepsiCo
Pension Plan,  determined as of the Close of the Distribution  Date, is not less
than the sum of the  414(l)(1)  Amounts  for the  PepsiCo  Pension  Plan and the
TRICON Pension Plan  determined in accordance  with (A) above,  then such assets
shall be allocated  between the PepsiCo Pension Plan and the TRICON Pension Plan
in proportion to the 414(l)(1) Amounts of each plan.

                    (C) If the  aggregate  amount of the  assets of the  PepsiCo
Pension Plan,  determined as of the Close of the Distribution  Date is less than
the sum of the  414(l)(1)  Amounts for the PepsiCo  Pension  Plan and the TRICON
Pension Plan,  then such assets shall be allocated  between the PepsiCo  Pension
Plan and the TRICON Pension Plan  proportionately  to each priority  category as
specified under ERISA Sec. 4044, using the assumptions specified in (A) above.

               (2)     Transfer of Assets to TRICON Pension Trusts

        Effective  Immediately after the Distribution  Date, PepsiCo shall cause
to be  transferred  from the PepsiCo  Master Trust to the TRICON Master Trust an
initial amount of assets in cash ("the Initial Asset  Transfer").  The amount of
the Initial Asset  Transfer  shall be an estimate,  determined by PepsiCo in its
sole  discretion,  of the cash required by the TRICON Pension Plan and Pizza Hut
Pension  Plan to make  payment of benefits  and  appropriate  expenses  from the
TRICON  Master Trust in  accordance  with the plans from  Immediately  after the
Distribution  Date to the time of the Bulk Asset Transfer,  described  below. In
the event that the Initial Asset Transfer  provides  insufficient  cash for this
purpose and upon TRICON's  written  request  therefor,  PepsiCo will cause to be
transferred other amounts of assets in cash ("Subsequent  Asset Transfer"),  but
only to the extent required to make cash payments as described above.

   
        As soon as practicable  after the calculation of each plan's interest in
the Master Trust pursuant to Section  3.3(b)(1),  but in no event before PepsiCo
(or its authorized  representative) determines that the calculation and the data
on which it is based are acceptably complete, accurate, and consistent,  PepsiCo
will cause the appropriate  amount of assets to be transferred  from the PepsiCo
Master Trust to the TRICON Master Trust (the "Bulk Asset Transfer").  The amount
of assets to be  transferred  in the Bulk Asset  Transfer  shall be equal to the
aggregate of interests of the TRICON Pension Plan determined pursuant to Section
3.3(b)(1) and the Pizza Hut Pension Plan,  adjusted by PepsiCo as of the date of
the Bulk Asset Transfer to the extent necessary or appropriate to reasonably and
appropriately reflect additional pension contributions,  actual investment gains
and losses experienced in the PepsiCo Master Trust, benefit payments,  expenses,
the Initial  Asset  Transfer,  Subsequent  Asset  Transfers,  data  corrections,
enhancements,   and   computational   refinements  from  Immediately  after  the
Distribution Date through the date of the actual asset transfer of such assets.
    

        The specific  assets to be transferred  from the PepsiCo Master Trust to
the TRICON Master Trust in the Bulk Asset Transfer shall  represent a reasonable
cross-section  of the asset classes in the PepsiCo Master Trust  consistent with
the  objective of enabling  TRICON to implement  an  investment  program for the
TRICON Master Trust,  but in no event shall PepsiCo or the PepsiCo  Master Trust
be  required  to  incur  unreasonable   transaction  costs  in  the  process  of
transferring assets and subsequently  re-balancing the investment portfolio held
by the PepsiCo Master Trust. Furthermore,  PepsiCo shall not transfer any shares
of PepsiCo or TRICON stock or any interests in group annuity  contracts  held by
the PepsiCo Master Trust unless specifically requested by TRICON in writing, and
PepsiCo shall not be required to transfer any specific asset, any portion of any
specific  fund or investment  manager  account,  or any specific  portion of any
specific asset,  fund or investment  manager account.  In transferring  specific
assets,  PepsiCo  makes  no  representation  as to  the  appropriateness  of the
resulting asset allocation or investment performance resulting from the specific
assets  transferred.  By accepting the assets  transferred,  TRICON acknowledges
that it and not PepsiCo is serving as the  fiduciary for the TRICON Master Trust
with respect to the determination and actual transfer of assets from the PepsiCo
Master Trust and that, acting as fiduciary for the TRICON Pension Plan and Pizza
Hut Pension  Plan,  TRICON  further  acknowledges  that it is able to change the
asset allocation as it deems  appropriate at any time. Once the assets have been
transferred  to and received by the TRICON Master Trust,  such event shall fully
and finally  foreclose  any issue or matter of any nature  whatsoever by TRICON,
the TRICON Master Trust, the TRICON Pension Plan, and the Pizza Hut Pension Plan
or any other trust(s) related to such plans against PepsiCo,  the PepsiCo Master
Trust,  the PepsiCo  Pension Plan, or any other  trust(s)  related to such plans
relating to the  condition,  identity,  or value of such assets and TRICON shall
fully indemnify PepsiCo,  its employees,  officers,  directors,  and the PepsiCo
Pension Plan and the PepsiCo Master Trust  regarding any Liability or regulatory
issue of any nature with respect thereto.

 3.4     ACTION IN EVENT OF PBGC INTERVENTION

   
        Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,  in the
event that at any time the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") asserts
that the Distribution may provide  justification for PBGC to seek termination of
the PepsiCo  Pension Plan pursuant to ERISA Sec. 4042 or otherwise  asserts that
the transaction may increase  unreasonably the long-run loss to the PBGC (within
the meaning of ERISA Sec.  4042(a)(4)) with respect to the PepsiCo Pension Plan,
PepsiCo may, in its sole discretion (i) retain all assets and  Liabilities  with
respect to Transferred  Individuals and Transition Individuals under the PepsiCo
Pension Plan and/or the PepsiCo Pension  Equalization Plan and require TRICON to
provide equivalent  benefits under plans maintained by it with an offset for any
benefits  continued  to be provided  under the PepsiCo  Pension  Plan and/or the
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, (ii) enter into negotiations with the PBGC to
resolve  these issues and, upon  satisfactorily  resolving  such issues,  TRICON
shall  fully  comply with the terms of this  Article;  or (iii) reach such other
agreement  as may be  satisfactory  to  PepsiCo  and  TRICON.  In any  case  and
notwithstanding  any other  provision of this  Agreement,  TRICON shall be fully
responsible and liable for any obligation to, agreement with, or undertaking (on
behalf of or  relating  to the TRICON  Pension  Plan) to the PBGC and shall hold
PepsiCo free from and fully indemnify it against any such obligation, agreement,
or  undertaking.  For  purposes of this  Section  3.4,  reference to the PepsiCo
Pension or the TRICON  Pension Plan, as  applicable,  shall mean and include the
Pizza Hut Pension  Plan.  If PepsiCo  retains any  liability of any  Transferred
Individual  under the PepsiCo  Pension  Equalization  Plan,  TRICON  shall fully
reimburse  PepsiCo  for the full cash  costs of,  including  any  administrative
expenses relating to, any such liability.

                           DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS


 4.1     SAVINGS PLAN

        (a)     Savings Plan Trust

        Effective   Immediately  after  the  Distribution   Date,  TRICON  shall
establish, or cause to be established, a trust qualified under Code Sec. 401(a),
exempt from taxation under Code Sec.  501(a)(1),  and forming part of the TRICON
Savings Plan.

        (b)     Assumption of Liabilities and Transfer of Assets

        Effective  Immediately  after  the  Distribution  Date:  (i) the  TRICON
Savings  Plan  shall  assume  and be  solely  responsible  for  all  Liabilities
(including any amounts attributable to additional  contributions with respect to
Transferred  Individuals  required  pursuant to  negotiations  with the Internal
Revenue  Service  that began  before the  Distribution  Date) to or  relating to
Transferred  Individuals under the PepsiCo Savings Plan; (ii) the TRICON Savings
Plan  shall  assume  and be  solely  responsible  for all  ongoing  rights of or
relating to  Transferred  Individuals  for future  participation  (including the
right to make  contributions  through payroll  deductions) in the TRICON Savings
Plan; and (iii) PepsiCo shall cause the accounts of the Transferred  Individuals
under the PepsiCo  Savings  Plan which are held by its  related  trust as of the
Close of the Distribution  Date to be transferred to the TRICON Savings Plan and
its  related  trust,  and TRICON  shall  cause such  transferred  accounts to be
accepted by such plan and trust.  Effective no later than Immediately  after the
Distribution  Date,  TRICON shall use its reasonable  best efforts to enter into
such agreements to accomplish such assumptions and transfers, the maintenance of
the necessary  participant  records,  the  appointment  of State Street Bank and
Trust  Company  as  initial  trustee  under the  TRICON  Savings  Plan,  and the
engagement of State Street Bank and Trust Company as initial  recordkeeper under
such plans.  As soon as practicable  after the Close of the  Distribution  Date,
assets  related  to  the  accounts  of  all  Transferred  Individuals  shall  be
transferred  from the PepsiCo Savings Plan to the TRICON Savings Plan in cash or
in kind,  at  PepsiCo's  discretion,  and to the  extent  practicable,  shall be
invested in  comparable  investment  options in the TRICON  Savings Plan as such
accounts were invested immediately before the Close of the Distribution Date.

        (c)     Non-Employer Stock Funds

        Effective Immediately after the Distribution Date, a TRICON common stock
fund shall be added as an investment  option to the PepsiCo Savings Plan and the
TRICON  Savings Plan shall  provide for both a PepsiCo  capital stock fund and a
TRICON common stock fund as investment options.  The TRICON common stock fund in
the  PepsiCo  Savings  Plan and the  PepsiCo  capital  stock  fund in the TRICON
Savings Plan are each referred to as a "Non-Employer Stock Fund" with respect to
the applicable plan. Each Non-Employer  Stock Fund shall be maintained under the
respective Plan at least through December 31, 1998. The PepsiCo Savings Plan and
the TRICON Savings Plan shall each provide that, after the Distribution Date, no
new  contributions  may be invested in, and no amounts may be  transferred  from
other  investment  options to the  Non-Employer  Stock Fund under the respective
Plan. The PepsiCo Savings Plan shall provide that no earnings or dividends under
its  Non-Employer  Stock Fund may be  reinvested  in TRICON Common Stock and the
TRICON  Savings  Plan shall  provide  that no  earnings or  dividends  under its
Non-Employer Stock Fund may be reinvested in PepsiCo Capital Stock.

        (d)     Miscellaneous Funds

        In  the  event  that  PepsiCo  determines  that  it is not  feasible  or
appropriate to transfer in-kind the assets of a particular  investment fund from
the  PepsiCo  Savings  Plan to the TRICON  Savings  Plan,  then the value of the
assets,  as of the close of business  on the  Distribution  Date (plus  earnings
attributable  to such amount from the  Distribution  Date to the date the assets
are actually  transferred)  shall be  transferred  in cash to the TRICON Savings
Plan and TRICON  shall invest such cash in its plan and trust in the same manner
and  proportion  as it was invested in the PepsiCo  Savings Plan or otherwise at
the direction of each affected participant.

 4.2     ESOP

        At PepsiCo's  election and as soon as reasonably  practicable  after the
Distribution  Date  with  respect  to  Transferred  Individuals  and  Transition
Individuals,   after  transfer  to  TRICON,  the  accounts  of  all  Transferred
Individuals and Transition Individuals (described in Section 1.1(ddd)(2) or (3))
shall either be (i) retained under the PepsiCo Employee Stock Ownership Plan and
such  individuals  shall not be  considered to have  terminated  service for any
purposes under the Plan, or (ii) shall be transferred to the TRICON Savings Plan
and  invested in the PepsiCo or TRICON  stock funds,  as  applicable,  under the
TRICON  Savings  Plan  or,  if such is not  possible,  in such  fund or funds as
otherwise  determined  by TRICON or, at TRICON's  election,  as directed by each
such  Transferred  Individual or  Transition  Individual,  respectively.  If the
accounts of  Transferred  Individuals  and Transition  Individuals  are retained
under the PepsiCo Employee Stock Ownership Plan, TRICON will undertake to inform
PepsiCo of any change in  employment  status or any relevant  information  about
TRICON employees who have balances in the PepsiCo Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

                            HEALTH AND WELFARE PLANS


 5.1     ASSUMPTION OF HEALTH AND WELFARE PLAN LIABILITIES

        Immediately after the Distribution Date, all Liabilities for or relating
to Transferred  Individuals under the PepsiCo Health and Welfare Plans,  PepsiCo
Restaurant  Health and Welfare  Plans or TRICON  Health and Welfare  Plans shall
cease to be  Liabilities of PepsiCo or the PepsiCo Plans and shall be assumed by
TRICON  and  the  TRICON  Health  and  Welfare  Plans.  Thus,  TRICON  shall  be
responsible  for  all  Liabilities  that  pertain  to  Transferred  Individuals,
including  all  reported  claims that are unpaid,  all incurred but not reported
claims as of the Close of the  Distribution  Date,  and all future  claims  that
pertain to Transferred  Individuals  under the PepsiCo Health and Welfare Plans,
PepsiCo  Restaurant  Health and Welfare  Plans and the TRICON Health and Welfare
Plans.  TRICON  shall  be  required  to make  all  payments  due or  payable  to
Transferred Individuals under the TRICON Health and Welfare Plans for the period
beginning  Immediately after the Distribution  Date,  including incurred but not
reported claims.  All treatments which have been  pre-certified for or are being
provided to a Transferred  Individual as of the Close of the  Distribution  Date
shall continue to be provided without  interruption under the appropriate TRICON
Health and Welfare  Plan and TRICON  shall  continue to be  responsible  for all
Liabilities  relating  to,  arising  out of, or  resulting  from  such  on-going
treatments  as  of  the  Close  of  the  Distribution   Date.  Unless  otherwise
specifically  set  forth in  writing,  TRICON  shall not be  entitled  to assets
associated with any PepsiCo Health and Welfare Plan,  PepsiCo  Restaurant Health
and Welfare Plan, or TRICON Health and Welfare Plan  including,  but not limited
to,  premium  stabilization  reserves,  contract  or plan  surpluses,  any other
reserve,  prior  inter-company  assessments  or premiums,  any prior  per-capita
inter-company  rate payments,  reimbursement for charges or premiums  previously
collected  or any other  payment  or  credit,  of any  nature  whatsoever,  from
PepsiCo,  any trust  associated with any plan or program or from any third-party
vendor.

 5.2     ESTABLISHMENT OF MIRROR LTD VEBA

        On or before the Distribution Date, TRICON shall establish,  or cause to
be  established,  the TRICON  LTD VEBA,  for the  purpose  of funding  long-term
disability  benefits under the TRICON Health and Welfare Plans. Such trust shall
constitute   a  voluntary   employees'   beneficiary   association   under  Code
Sec.501(c)(9)  which is exempt from the  imposition of federal  income tax under
Code Sec.501(a).

 5.3     LTD VEBA ASSET TRANSFERS

This  Section 5.3 shall  govern the transfer of assets from the PepsiCo LTD VEBA
to the  TRICON  LTD  VEBA.  As  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Close  of the
Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo shall determine the aggregate  present value, as of
the Close of the  Distribution  Date, of the future benefit  obligations of each
PepsiCo  Plan  funded  by the  PepsiCo  LTD VEBA  (separately  with  respect  to
Transferred  Individuals who are eligible to receive  benefits under the PepsiCo
LTD VEBA as of the Close of the  Distribution  Date,  and with  respect to other
individuals  who are not  Transferred  Individuals  who are  eligible  for  such
benefits).  The future  benefit  obligations  will be  determined by the actuary
appointed by PepsiCo, for purposes of providing necessary actuarial services for
the PepsiCo  LTD VEBA,  in the  following  manner:  the  disabled  life  reserve
(exclusive of the incurred but not reported ("IBNR") reserve) will be calculated
as of the  Close  of the  Distribution  Date  using  September  1,  1997  census
information  requested from the third-party  administrator  (Aetna). The reserve
for the lives that will be transferred to TRICON will be calculated  separately.
The actuarial  basis for the disabled life reserve will be calculated  using the
following  assumptions:  interest  at 7%  compounded  annually;  termination  of
disability  based on rates of recovery  and  mortality  developed  from the 1975
study of the Society of  Actuaries  of  experience  under Group LTD policies for
durations of disablement of three years or less. For durations of disablement in
excess of three years,  assumed  terminations are based on a modification of the
1952 Disability Study. As soon as practicable after such  determination is made,
there shall be  transferred  from the PepsiCo LTD VEBA to the TRICON LTD VEBA an
amount  having a fair market  value on the date of transfer  equal to the amount
calculated  as [(A)/(B)] x (C),  where "(A)" is the disabled  life reserve as of
the Close of the  Distribution  Date for the lives that will be  transferred  to
TRICON using  September 1, 1997 census  information;  "(B)" is the disabled life
reserve  for all  lives  under  the  PepsiCo  LTD  VEBA as of the  Close  of the
Distribution Date using September 1, 1997 census  information;  and "(C)" is the
market  value of the PepsiCo LTD VEBA  assets on the date of  transfer.  PepsiCo
shall direct the trustee of the PepsiCo LTD VEBA to transfer cash to the trustee
of the TRICON LTD VEBA in the amount  determined  above and TRICON  shall direct
the trustee of the TRICON LTD VEBA to accept such cash transfer.

 5.4     CONTRIBUTIONS TO, INVESTMENTS OF, AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM VEBAS

        Before  the Close of the  Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo  shall  have sole
authority  to direct the  trustee of the  PepsiCo  LTD VEBA,  and any other VEBA
sponsored by PepsiCo, as to the timing and manner of any contributions,  if any,
to the PepsiCo LTD VEBA, and any other VEBA sponsored by PepsiCo, the investment
of any trust assets,  and the distributions  and/or transfers of trust assets to
PepsiCo,  TRICON, any Participating Company in the trusts, any paying agent, any
successor trustee, or any other Person.

 5.5     VENDOR CONTRACTS

        (a) ASO Contracts,  Group Insurance Policies, HMO Agreements and Letters
of Understanding

               (1)  Before the  Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo shall,  in its sole
discretion,  take such steps as are  necessary  under each ASO  Contract,  Group
Insurance Policy, HMO Agreement and letters of understanding and arrangements in
existence as of the date of this  Agreement to permit TRICON to  participate  in
the terms and  conditions  of such ASO Contract,  Group  Insurance  Policy,  HMO
Agreement or letters of understanding  and arrangements  from Immediately  after
the  Distribution  Date  through  December  31,  1998.   PepsiCo,  in  its  sole
discretion,  may  cause  one or  more  of its  ASO  Contracts,  Group  Insurance
Policies,  HMO Agreements and letters of  understanding  and  arrangements  into
which PepsiCo enters after the date of this  Agreement,  but before the Close of
the  Distribution  Date,  to  allow  TRICON  to  participate  in the  terms  and
conditions  thereof.  Nothing  contained in this Section  5.5(a) shall  preclude
PepsiCo from choosing to enter into ASO Contracts, Group Insurance Policies, HMO
Agreements  or other  letters of  understandings  and  arrangements  with new or
different vendors.

               (2) PepsiCo shall have the right to determine, and shall promptly
notify TRICON of, the manner in which  TRICON's  participation  in the terms and
conditions of ASO Contracts,  Group Insurance Policies, HMO Agreements,  letters
of understanding  and arrangements as set forth above shall be effectuated.  The
permissible ways in which TRICON's participation may be effectuated include, but
are not limited to,  automatically  making TRICON a party to the ASO  Contracts,
Group  Insurance  Policies,  HMO  Agreement  or  letters  of  understanding  and
arrangements  or  obligating  the  third  party to  enter  into a  separate  ASO
Contract,  Group Insurance  Policy, or HMO Agreement or letters of understanding
and arrangements with TRICON providing (to the extent  practicable and agreeable
to such third party) for the same terms and  conditions  as are contained in the
ASO  Contracts,   Group  Insurance  Policies,  HMO  Agreements  and  letters  of
understanding  and  arrangements  to which  PepsiCo  is a party.  Such terms and
conditions shall include the financial and termination  provisions,  performance
standards,   methodology,   auditing  policies,   quality  measures,   reporting
requirements and target claims.  TRICON hereby authorizes  PepsiCo to act on its

period  based  solely  on  TRICON's   performance  and  PepsiCo  shall  have  no
responsibility,  financial or otherwise,  to Transferred  Individuals  for these
1996 or later  Awards.  To the  extent any Award of  performance  units has been
assumed by TRICON, any shares distributable by reason of such Awards shall be in

Liabilities  notwithstanding  any failure by TRICON to complete its  obligations

                             TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS


 8.1     TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS/RECOGNITION OF SERVICE

        The parties intend that, for the duration of the Transition  Period, the
respective  Plans of  PepsiCo  and  TRICON  shall  mutually  recognize  service,
compensation,  and  other  benefit  determining  factors  (except  as  otherwise
provided  herein  with  respect to stock  options)  with  respect to  Transition
Individuals as if the Transition  Individual's  service recognized by either the
PepsiCo Group or the TRICON Group, respectively, had been performed entirely for
the Hiring  Company.  In this regard,  in determining a Transition  Individual's
service under the Hiring  Company's  Pension Plan,  Pension  Equalization  Plan,
Savings Plan,  SharePower Plan,  Stock Purchase Plan,  Health and Welfare Plans,
Executive Programs,  vacation and payroll practices, and other Plans, the Hiring
Company  shall  grant  full  credit  for  and   recognition  of  the  Transition

Hiring Company: (i) the Hiring Company's Pension Plan shall assume and be solely
responsible  for all  Liabilities  to or relating to the  Transition  Individual
under the Prior  Company's  Pension  Plan;  and (ii) no  pension  benefits  with
respect to the  Transition  Individual  from a Prior  Company's  Pension Plan or
Pension  Equalization  Plan shall  commence  while he or she is  employed by the

        (b)     Asset/Liability Allocations and Transfers

   
        PepsiCo or TRICON,  as applicable,  shall arrange to transfer assets and
liabilities  relating to the  benefit of each  Transition  Individual  under the
Prior Company  Pension Plan to the Hiring  Company  Pension Plan.  The liability
related to each such  Transition  Individual  shall be  calculated in accordance
with the same procedures and assumptions  described in Section 3.3(b)  effective
as of the date the Transition  Individual is transferred to the Hiring  Company.
The  transfer  of  assets  relating  to such  liability  shall  occur as soon as
practicable  after the  Transition  Period and a single net  aggregate  transfer
shall take place in accordance  with the  procedures  described in the following
paragraph.

        The amount of assets related to each Transition Individual shall be 100%
of the benefit  liability  calculated  at the  effective  date of the  transfer,
adjusted to reflect  interest at a rate equal to the yield on the Northern Trust
Collective Short-Term Investment Fund from the effective date of the transfer to
the date the assets are transferred. The amount of assets so calculated shall be
aggregated for all Transition  Individuals  transferring  from PepsiCo to TRICON
and for all  Transition  Individuals  transferring  from TRICON to PepsiCo.  The
company with the greater  aggregate  amount of assets shall  substract the other

trusts  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Transition  Individual's  date of
transfer; and (ii) the Hiring Company shall cause the transferred accounts to be
accepted  by its plans and trusts;  and (iii) as soon as the assets  relating to
the Transition Individual's account have been transferred,  the Hiring Company's
Savings Plan shall assume and be solely  responsible  for all  Liabilities to or
relating to the Transition  Individual under the  corresponding  Prior Company's
Savings Plan.  Assets may be transferred  from the Prior Company Savings Plan to
the  Hiring  Company  Savings  Plan  in  cash  or in  kind  and,  to the  extent
practicable,   the  Transition   Individual's  accounts  shall  be  invested  in
comparable  investment  options under the Hiring Company  Savings Plan as his or
her accounts were  invested  under the Prior  Company  Savings Plan  immediately
before the transfer.

Welfare Plans of the other company and its affiliates. Each Hiring Company shall
apply such elections under its Health and Welfare Plans for the remainder of the
period  or  periods  for  which  the  elections  are by their  terms  originally
applicable; provided, however that Hiring Company shall cause the Hiring Company
Health and Welfare  Plans to permit new coverage and  contribution  elections by

shall be transferred to and be in full force and effect under the  corresponding

 9.8  REQUESTS FOR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RULINGS AND UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT
      OF LABOR OPINIONS

        (a)     Cooperation

        TRICON shall  cooperate  fully with PepsiCo on any issue relating to the
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement for which PepsiCo elects to seek a
determination  letter or private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
or an advisory opinion from the United States Department of Labor. PepsiCo shall
cooperate  fully with  TRICON with  respect to any  request for a  determination
letter or private  letter ruling from the Internal  Revenue  Service or advisory
opinion from the United  States  Department  of Labor with respect to any of the
TRICON Plans relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (b)     Applications

        PepsiCo and TRICON shall make such applications to regulatory  agencies,
including  the Internal  Revenue  Service and the United  States  Department  of
Labor,  as may be  necessary  to ensure  that any  transfers  of assets from the
PepsiCo  LTD VEBA to the TRICON LTD VEBA will  neither (i) result in any adverse
tax,  legal or  fiduciary  consequences  to PepsiCo and TRICON,  the PepsiCo LTD
VEBA, the TRICON LTD VEBA, any participant  therein or beneficiaries  thereof, ,
any successor  welfare benefit funds  established by or on behalf of TRICON,  or
the trustees of such trusts,  nor (ii)  contravene  any statute,  regulation  or
technical pronouncement issued by any regulatory agency. Before the Close of the
Distribution  Date,  TRICON shall prepare all forms required to obtain favorable
determination  letters  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service with respect to the
tax-exempt  status of the TRICON LTD VEBA. TRICON and PepsiCo agree to cooperate
with each other to fulfill any filing and/or  regulatory  reporting  obligations
with respect to such transfers.

 9.9     FIDUCIARY AND RELATED MATTERS 

   
        The  Parties  acknowledge  that  PepsiCo  will not be a  fiduciary  with
respect to the TRICON Plans and that TRICON will not be a fiduciary with respect
to the PepsiCo Plans.  TRICON also acknowledges that PepsiCo shall not be deemed
to be in violation of this  Agreement if it fails to comply with any  provisions
hereof based upon its good faith  determination  that to do so would violate any
applicable  fiduciary  duties  or  standards  of  conduct  under  ERISA or other
applicable  law.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision in this  Agreement,  the
Parties may take such actions as  necessary or  appropriate  to  effectuate  the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.
    

 9.10   NON-TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

        No provision  of this  Agreement or the  Separation  Agreement  shall be
construed to create any right, or accelerate entitlement, to any compensation or
benefit  whatsoever on the part of any  Transferred  Individual or other future,
present,  or former  employee of the PepsiCo Group or the TRICON Group under any
PepsiCo Plan or TRICON Plan or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,  except as  expressly  provided  in this  Agreement:  (i) neither the
Distribution nor the termination of the Participating Company status of a member
of the TRICON  Group  shall cause any  employee to be deemed to have  incurred a
termination of employment  which entitles such individual to the commencement of
benefits under any of the PepsiCo Plans,  any of the TRICON Plans, or any of the
Individual  Agreements;  and (ii)  nothing  in this  Agreement  other than those
provisions  specifically set forth herein to the contrary shall preclude TRICON,
at any time after the Close of the  Distribution  Date, from amending,  merging,
modifying,  terminating,  eliminating,  reducing,  or otherwise  altering in any
respect  any TRICON  Plan,  any benefit  under any Plan or any trust,  insurance
policy or funding vehicle related to any TRICON Plan.

 9.11    COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

        To the  extent  any  provision  of this  Agreement  is  contrary  to the
provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement to which PepsiCo or
any  affiliate of PepsiCo is a party,  the terms of such  collective  bargaining
agreement  shall  prevail.  Should any provisions of this Agreement be deemed to
relate to a topic  determined  by an  appropriate  authority  to be a  mandatory
subject of collective bargaining,  PepsiCo or TRICON may be obligated to bargain
with the  union  representing  affected  employees  concerning  those  subjects.
Neither  party  will  agree  to a  modification  of  any  applicable  collective
bargaining  agreement  without  the  consent of the other.  In the event a force
surplus affecting members of a bargaining unit in both the PepsiCo Group (on the
one hand) and the TRICON Group (on the other hand) directly results,  due to the
provisions  of  such  a  collective   bargaining   agreement,   in  an  employee
involuntarily  leaving the payroll of the party not declaring the surplus,  then
the party declaring the surplus shall bear the cost of any severance  payable to
such employee.

 9.12    CONSENT OF THIRD PARTIES

        If any  provision  of this  Agreement is dependent on the consent of any
third party (such as a vendor or a union) and such consent is withheld,  PepsiCo
and TRICON shall use their  reasonable  best efforts to implement the applicable
provisions of this Agreement to the full extent practicable. If any provision of
this Agreement  cannot be implemented  due to the failure of such third party to
consent,  PepsiCo and TRICON  shall  negotiate  in good faith to  implement  the
provision  in a  mutually  satisfactory  manner.  The  phrase  "reasonable  best
efforts"  as used in this  Agreement  shall  not be  construed  to  require  the
incurrence of any non-routine or unreasonable expense or liability or the waiver
of any right.

 9.13    FOREIGN PLANS

        As soon as  practicable  after the date of this  Agreement,  PepsiCo and
TRICON shall enter into an agreement  regarding  the  treatment of Foreign Plans
consistent with the principles set forth in Appendix C.

 9.14    EFFECT IF DISTRIBUTION DOES NOT OCCUR

        If the  Distribution  does not occur,  then all  actions and events that
are, under this Agreement, to be taken or occur effective as of the Close of the
Distribution  Date,  Immediately  after the  Distribution  Date, or otherwise in
connection  with the  Distribution,  shall  not be taken or occur  except to the
extent specifically agreed by TRICON and PepsiCo.

 9.15    RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES

        Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed by the parties or
any third party as creating the relationship of principal and agent, partnership
or joint venture  between the parties,  it being  understood  and agreed that no
provision contained herein, and no act of the parties, shall be deemed to create
any  relationship  between the  parties  other than the  relationship  set forth
herein.

 9.16    AFFILIATES

        Each of  PepsiCo  and TRICON  shall  cause to be  performed,  and hereby
guarantees the performance of, all actions, agreements and obligations set forth
in this  Agreement to be performed by members of the PepsiCo Group or members of
the TRICON Group, respectively, where relevant.

 9.17    ARBITRATION

        Any  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this  Agreement,
or the breach hereof,  shall be settled by  arbitration  in accordance  with the
then  prevailing  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules  of  the  American  Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") as such rules may be modified herein.

        An award  rendered in connection  with an  arbitration  pursuant to this
Section  shall be final  and  binding  and  judgment  upon  such an award may be
entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

        The forum for arbitration under this Section shall be agreed upon by the
Parties, or, failing such agreement, shall be New York, New York.

        Arbitration shall be conducted by a single  arbitrator  selected jointly
by PepsiCo and TRICON. If within 30 days after a demand for arbitration is made,
PepsiCo and TRICON are unable to agree on a single arbitrator, three arbitrators
shall be appointed.  Within 30 days after such  inability to agree,  PepsiCo and
TRICON shall each select one  arbitrator  and those two  arbitrators  shall then
select a third arbitrator unaffiliated with either Party. In connection with the
selection of the third  arbitrator,  consideration  shall be give to familiarity
with employee  benefit plans and programs and related  matters and experience in
dispute resolution between parties, as a judge or otherwise.  If the arbitrators
selected by PepsiCo and TRICON cannot agree on the third arbitrator  within such
30 day period,  they shall discuss the  qualifications  of such third arbitrator
with the AAA prior to selection of such arbitrator,  which selection shall be in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA.

        If an arbitrator  cannot continue to serve, a successor to an arbitrator
selected by PepsiCo or TRICON, as the case may be, also shall be selected by the
same Party,  and a  successor  to the  neutral  arbitrator  shall be selected as
specified above. A full rehearing will be held only if the neutral arbitrator is
unable to continue to serve or if the remaining  arbitrators  unanimously  agree
that such a rehearing is appropriate.

        The arbitrator or  arbitrators  shall be guided,  but not bound,  by the
Federal  Rules of Evidence  and by the  procedural  rules,  including  discovery
provisions,  of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure.  Any  discovery  shall be
limited  to  information  directly  relevant  to the  controversy  or  claim  in
arbitration.

 9.18    INDEMNIFICATION

        Effective on the Distribution  Date, TRICON agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each member of the PepsiCo Group and each of their respective officers,
directors,  employees  and agents and the PepsiCo Plans from and against any and
all losses,  Liabilities,  claims, suits, damages, costs and expenses (including
without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  any  and  all  expenses
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any pending
or seriously  threatened  litigation or claim)  arising out of or related in any
manner to  Transferred  Individuals  and  Transition  Individuals  described  in
Section  1.1(ddd)(2) and (3).  Similarly,  effective on the  Distribution  Date,
PepsiCo  agrees to indemnify  and hold  harmless each member of the TRICON Group
and each of their respective officers,  directors,  employees and agents and the
TRICON Plans from and against any and all losses,  Liabilities,  claims,  suits,
damages,   costs  and  expenses  (including,   without,   limitation  reasonable
attorneys' fees and any and all expenses  reasonably  incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any pending or seriously threatened litigation or
claim)  arising out of or related in any manner to Transferred  Individuals  and
Transition Individuals described in Section 1.1(ddd)(1) and (4).

        If any action is brought or any claim is made  against a Party or person
in respect of which  indemnity may be sought  pursuant to this Section 9.18 (the
"Indemnitee"),  the  Indemnitee  shall,  within  ten days  after the  receipt of
information  indicating that an action or claim is likely, notify in writing the
Party from whom  indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") of the institution
of the  action or the  making of the claim,  and the  Indemnitor  shall have the
right,  and at the  request of the  Indemnitee,  shall have the  obligation,  to
assume the defense of the action or claim,  including the employment of counsel.
If the  Indemnitor  assumes the defense of the action or claim,  the  Indemnitor
shall be  entitled  to settle  the  action or claim on behalf of the  Indemnitee
without the prior  written  consent of the  Indemnitee  unless  such  settlement
would,  in  addition  to the  payment of money,  materially  affect the  ongoing
business or employment of the Indemnitee.

        The Indemnitee  shall have the right to employ its own counsel,  but the
fees and expenses of that counsel shall be the  responsibility of the Indemnitee
unless (i) the employment of that counsel shall have been  authorized in writing
by the  Indemnitor in connection  with the defense of the action or claim;  (ii)
the Indemnitor  shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of
such action or claim; or (iii) such Indemnitee  shall have reasonably  concluded
that  there  may be  defenses  available  to it  which  are  different  from  or
additional to those  available to the  Indemnitor  (in which case the Indemnitor
shall not have the right to direct any different  defense of the action or claim
on behalf of the Indemnitee).  The Indemnitee shall, in any event, be kept fully
informed  of the  defense  of any such  action  or claim.  Except  as  expressly
provided  above,  in the event that the  Indemnitor  shall not  previously  have
assumed the defense of an action or claim,  at such time as the Indemnitor  does
assume the defense of the action or claim,  the Indemnitor  shall not thereafter
be liable to any Indemnitee for legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnitee in  investigating,  preparing or defending against such action or
claim.

        Anything  in this  Section  9.18 to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the
Indemnitor  shall  not be  liable  for any  settlement  of any  claim or  action
effected  without  its written  consent;  provided,  however,  that if after due
notice the Indemnitor  refuses to defend a claim or action, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to defend and/or settle such action, and the Indemnitee shall not
be precluded from making a claim against the Indemnitor for reasonable  expenses
and liabilities resulting from such defense and/or settlement in accordance with
this Section 9.18.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.18, there may
be particular  actions or claims which  reasonably  could result in both Parties
being  liable  to  the  other  under  the  indemnification  provisions  of  this
Agreement. In such events, the Parties shall endeavor,  acting reasonably and in
good faith,  to agree upon a manner of conducting  the defense and settlement of
the action or claim with a view to minimizing  the legal expenses and associated
costs  that might  otherwise  be  incurred  by the  Parties,  such as, by way of
illustration only, agreeing to use the same legal counsel.

        The  indemnification  provisions of this Section 9.18 shall not inure to
the benefit of any third  party.  By way of  illustration  only,  an insurer who
would  otherwise  be  obligated  to pay any claim  shall not be  relieved of the
responsibility with respect thereto, or, solely by virtue of the indemnification
provisions,  hereof,  have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being
expressly  understood  and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall
be  entitled  to a  "windfall"  (i.e.,  a benefit  they would not be entitled to
receive in the  absence of the  indemnification  provisions)  by virtue of these
indemnification provisions.

 9.19    NOTICES

        Any notice,  demand,  claim, or other communication under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall given in accordance with the provisions for giving
notice under the Separation Agreement.

 9.20    INTERPRETATION

        Words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa
and  words of one  gender  shall be held to  include  the other  genders  as the
context  requires.  The terms  "hereof,"  "herein," and  "herewith" and words of
similar import shall,  unless  otherwise  stated,  be construed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole  (including all Exhibits  hereto) and not to any particular
provision of this  Agreement.  The word  "including" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement shall mean "including,  without  limitation," unless
the context  otherwise  requires or unless  otherwise  specified.  The word "or"
shall not be exclusive.

 9.21    GOVERNING LAW/EXECUTION

        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of North Carolina, may not be assigned by either Party without
the written consent of the other, and shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their  respective  successors and permitted  assignees.  This
Agreement may not be amended or  supplemented  except by an agreement in writing
signed by PepsiCo and TRICON.  This  Agreement may be executed in  counterparts,
each of which  shall be  deemed  an  original  and all of which  together  shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

        IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties  have caused  this  Employee  Programs
Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

                                  FOREIGN PLANS


        This Appendix C describes the principles under which Foreign Plans shall
be treated. For purposes of this Appendix, outside the U.S. means outside the 50
United States,  its territories and  possessions,  and the District of Columbia,
and  employed  outside  the U.S.  means  compensated  under a  payroll  which is
administered outside the U.S..

C.1     Plans Covering only Employees of PepsiCo or TRICON

        Effective as of the Close of the Distribution Date or such later date as
may be required by  applicable  law,  union,  or works  council  agreement,  any
Foreign  Plan that  covers  only  individuals  employed  outside the U.S. by the
PepsiCo  Group  shall be the sole  responsibility  of the  PepsiCo  Group and no
member of the TRICON Group shall have any Liability with respect to such a Plan;
and any Foreign Plan that covers only  individuals  employed outside the U.S. by
the TRICON  Group shall be the sole  responsibility  of the TRICON  Group and no
member of the PepsiCo  Group  shall have any  Liability  with  respect to such a
Plan.

C.2     Plans Covering Employees of Both PepsiCo and TRICON



        (a)    Termination of Participation

        Effective  as  of  the  Close  of  the  Distribution  Date,  if  legally
permitted,  or as soon as possible thereafter,  TRICON and each other applicable
member of the TRICON  Group  shall cease to be a  Participating  Company in each
Foreign  Plan  maintained  by the  PepsiCo  Group  and  PepsiCo  and each  other
applicable member of the PepsiCo Group shall cease to be a Participating Company
in each Foreign Plan maintained by the TRICON Group.

        (b)    Mirror Plans

               (1)  Effective  Immediately  after the Distribution  Date, TRICON
shall adopt, or cause to be adopted,  Foreign Plans for the benefit of employees
of the TRICON  Group  employed  outside  the United  States who are  eligible to
participate  in PepsiCo  Foreign Plans and shall cause such TRICON Foreign Plans
to be  substantially  identical  in all Material  Features to the  corresponding
PepsiCo Foreign Plans as in effect on the Distribution Date; provided,  however,
that  TRICON  may  satisfy  this  requirement  by  extending  coverage  to  such
individuals  under a Foreign Plan of the TRICON Group which was in effect before
the Distribution Date.

               (2)  Effective  Immediately after the Distribution  Date, PepsiCo
shall adopt,  or cause to be adopted,  Plans for the benefit of employees of the
PepsiCo Group employed outside the United States who are eligible to participate
in Plans  and  shall  cause  such  Plans to be  substantially  identical  in all
Material Features to the corresponding  TRICON Foreign Plans as in effect on the
Distribution Date; provided,  however, that PepsiCo may satisfy this requirement
by extending or continuing  coverage to such individuals under a PepsiCo Foreign
Plan of the PepsiCo Group which was in effect before the Distribution Date.

               (3) The continuation by PepsiCo or TRICON of separate  employment
terms and  conditions  for employees  previously  covered by the other  entity's
Plans shall not continue beyond the time legally required.
 
        (c)    Transfer of Assets

        As of the Close of the  Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo and TRICON will use
their  reasonable best efforts to ensure that, to the extent legally  permitted:
(i)  Liabilities  of  the  Foreign  Plans  of  PepsiCo  relating to  Transferred
Individuals  shall be assumed by the  appropriate  Foreign Plans of TRICON;  and
(ii)  a  portion  of any  assets  of the  Foreign  Plans  of  PepsiCo  shall  be
transferred to the appropriate Foreign Plans of TRICON, and vice versa.

C.3     Severance Issues

        If under applicable law, any Transferred Individual employed outside the
U.S. is deemed to have incurred a  termination  of employment as a result of the
Distribution or any other transaction  contemplated by the Separation  Agreement
or this  Agreement,  which  entitles  such  individual to receive any payment or
benefit under any Foreign Plan,  governmental plan or arrangement or pursuant to
any  law or  regulation,  including  severance  benefits,  notwithstanding  such
individual's  continued  employment  by the TRICON  Group,  then TRICON shall be
liable for any such payment or benefit and,  notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, to the extent legally permitted,  appropriate  adjustments shall be made
to the treatment of such individual during such continued employment,  including
not  giving  such  individual  credit for prior  service  and/or  treating  such
individual as having been newly hired immediately after such deemed termination,
for purposes of all  applicable  Foreign  Plans.  Liability with respect to such
payments shall be the responsibility of TRICON.

C.4     Legally Permitted

        For purposes of this Appendix C,  "legally  permitted"  means  permitted
under the laws of the country,  the labor union,  works  council,  or collective
agreement  without  adverse  consequences  to  PepsiCo,  TRICON  or  Transferred
Individuals,  as  determined  by  PepsiCo,  in its  sole  discretion,  including
mandated waiting periods before which working  conditions  (including  benefits)
cannot  be  changed,  and upon  receiving  required  agreement  from  individual
employees  and/or Plan trustees,  foundation  boards and members,  and any other
organizations  having a recognized  right to determine or affect benefits and/or
funding of the Plan.

C.5     Multinational Pooling

        PepsiCo  and  TRICON  shall keep their  existing  multinational  pooling
arrangements  intact through December 31, 1997. If there is any dividend payable
from the  consolidated  pooling  arrangements  with  respect  to the  1997  pool
accounting  year,  that  dividend will be allocated  between  PepsiCo and TRICON
proportionately, based on the contribution to the overall surplus of the pooling
arrangements   by  the  PepsiCo  Group  and  the  TRICON  Group,   respectively.
Alternatively,  any net deficits  incurred  under any one (or all)  consolidated
pooling arrangement(s) will be apportioned back to the entity which incurred the
deficit proportionately based on each entities' contribution to the net deficit.

        Any potential additions (local insurance  contracts) to the consolidated
pooling  arrangement during the remainder of the 1997  international  accounting
period will be mutually agreed upon between PepsiCo and TRICON.

                                                          June 25, 1997



Mr. Andrall E. Pearson
Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, Inc.
375 Park Avenue, 18th Floor
New York, New York 10152

Dear Andy:

        This  letter  agreement  (the   "Agreement")   confirms  the  terms  and
conditions of your employment as Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer of TRICON
Global Restaurants,  Inc. ("TRICON"),  a newly formed North Carolina corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc.  ("PepsiCo").  TRICON was formed to
be the parent company for PepsiCo's quick service restaurant businesses. Subject
to certain  conditions,  in October 1997,  PepsiCo intends to spin off TRICON to
PepsiCo's shareholders (the "Spin-off").

        1.  Employment and Term.  You are hereby  employed as Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of TRICON for a term of three years,  commencing July 1, 1997.
Such term may, however, be modified pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.

        2. Duties. Prior to the Spin-off, you shall be responsible for assisting
with and  facilitating  the Spin-off,  including,  without  limitation,  matters
relating to TRICON's capital structure,  staffing,  investor  relations,  public
relations, benefits, compensation and operating structure. You will perform such
duties  consistent  with the  direction  and  decisions  of  PepsiCo's  Board of
Directors and senior management.

               At and after the  Spin-off,  you shall  have  supervision  of the
policies,  business  and affairs of TRICON,  and such other powers and duties as
are commonly incident to the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

        3. Compensation.  As compensation for your services hereunder, you shall
be paid a salary of $900,000 per year, in equal bi-weekly installments.

               You shall also receive annual  incentive  compensation in amounts
to be determined by the Compensation  Committee (the  "Committee") of the TRICON
Board of Directors based on performance objectives established by the Committee.
The target  incentive  compensation  for each year of this Agreement is $900,000
and bonus awards may range from zero to 200% of such target.  However, the bonus
for 1997  (payable in early 1998) shall be $450,000.  In addition,  you shall be
paid, by year end 1997, a one-time bonus of $850,000.

        4. Long-Term Incentives.  As soon as practicable after the Spin-off, the
Committee  shall  grant to you options to  purchase  1,050,000  shares of TRICON
Common Stock, par value $.05 per share (the "Options"). Such grant shall be made
pursuant to a separate option  agreement (the "Option  Agreement"),  the form of
which is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Option  Agreement,  350,000  Options shall vest on each of July 1, 1998, July 1,
1999 and July 1, 2000,  and, once vested,  shall be exercisable  for a period of
ten years from the date of grant.  The exercise  price for all Options  shall be
the mean of the closing prices for TRICON Common Stock for the fifth through the
twentieth trading day after the Spin-off.

        5.  Modification  of Term.  You agree that,  in order to effect an early
succession plan, the Committee may reduce the term of your employment  hereunder
and, in connection  therewith,  have the discretion to vest all unvested Options
granted pursuant to the Option Agreement, and pay 100% of the special retirement
payment provided for in Paragraph 6 hereof.

        6. Special  Retirement  Payment.  TRICON shall make a special $1,000,000
retirement  payment to you at the conclusion of your three-year  employment term
hereunder or such shorter term as may be determined by the Committee pursuant to
Paragraph 5. In the event of death or total  disability  (as  determined  by the
Committee),   you,  your  designated  beneficiary  or  estate  shall  receive  a
retirement  payment which is in  proportion  to your service  during the term of
this Agreement.

        7.     Benefits and Perquisites.

               a.  TRICON  shall  reimburse  you for dues,  initiation  fees and
capital or other special assessments at a country club of your choice.

               b. TRICON shall reimburse you for expenses,  not to exceed $5,000
per year, for personal financial planning.

               c.  TRICON  shall  provide  you  with  the  use  of an  executive
automobile,  and reimburse  expenses related to such automobile  consistent with
the PepsiCo executive car program for its most senior executives.

               d. You may  participate  in any  income  deferral  and  long-term
savings  (401(k))  plans,  as  well  as any  medical,  dental,  life  insurance,
disability  insurance or other  benefit or welfare  plans adopted by TRICON with
respect to its full-time employees.

        8. Death or  Disability.  In the event of your death or  disability  (as
determined  by the  Committee),  no  additional  amounts shall be due or payable
hereunder  except as provided in Paragraph 6 and in your Option  Agreement,  and
except for payments under TRICON's insurance programs.

        9. Non-Competition.  You agree that, while employed by TRICON, and for a
period of two years following the end of such employment, you shall not directly
or indirectly  participate or have any interest in, or own,  manage,  operate or
control,  or otherwise  engage,  invest or  participate  in any business that is
competitive with the business  conducted by TRICON or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates.  The  provisions  of this  Paragraph  9 shall  not  apply  to  stock
ownership  in a  publicly  traded  company  which is not in excess of 5% of that
company's outstanding equity securities.

        10. Notices.  All notices,  requests,  demands and other  communications
hereunder  shall be in writing and shall be  telecopied,  delivered by overnight
delivery  service or mailed to the intended  recipient at the address  specified
below,  or at such other address as either party may hereafter  designate to the
other.

                        SALES AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

        This Sales and  Distribution  Agreement  dated as of the 6th day of May,
1997, by and among PFS ("PFS"), an unincorporated  division of PepsiCo,  Inc., a
North  Carolina  corporation,  Pizza Hut, Inc., a Delaware  corporation  ("Pizza
Hut"), Taco Bell Corp., a California  corporation ("Taco Bell"),  Kentucky Fried
Chicken  Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation,  and Kentucky  Fried  Chicken of
California, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation and
Kentucky  Fried Chicken of California,  Inc. are together  referred to herein as
"KFCC");  (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFCC are collectively  referred to herein as
the "Customer").

        WHEREAS,   PFS  is  an  approved  distributor  of  all  proprietary  and
non-proprietary  food, supplies,  equipment,  smallwares,  uniforms,  beverages,
promotional  items and point of purchase  materials sold to Pizza Hut, Taco Bell
and KFC company owned and franchised (including licensed) restaurants; and

        WHEREAS, the Customer desires to appoint PFS, and PFS desires to act, as
the exclusive  distributor  of certain  proprietary  and non  proprietary  food,
supplies and smallwares  (but not  restaurant  equipment,  uniforms,  beverages,
promotional  items or point of purchase  materials)  sold to the  company  owned
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC  restaurants of the Customer within the continental
United States, all on the terms and conditions set forth herein;

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.  Appointment  as  Approved  Distributor  of  all  Company  Owned  and
    Franchised Restaurants.

        (a) The Customer hereby appoints PFS as an approved  distributor  during
the term of this Agreement of the Restaurant  Products  (defined  below) sold to
all Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants, whether franchised or owned by the
Customer or its  subsidiaries  or  affiliates,  in the United States  (including
Hawaii  and  Alaska),  Canada  and the  countries  where PFS  currently  exports
Restaurant  Products from its distribution  centers in the United States,  which
countries are listed in Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Export Countries").  PFS
understands  that the  appointment  contained in this Section 1 is not exclusive
and  that  PFS  shall  only  have  the  exclusive  distribution  rights  for the
restaurants and products described in Section 2 below.



<p class="break">


        (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restaurant Products" shall
mean all of the  proprietary  and  non-proprietary  food,  equipment,  supplies,
smallwares  (pans,  brooms,  cutting  knifes,  salt and pepper  shakers,  etc.),
uniforms, beverages, promotional items (basketballs,  puppets, movies, etc.) and
point of purchase  materials (table tents,  door hangers,  etc.) currently or in
the future  approved by the  respective  Customer for purchase by any Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell or KFC  company  owned or  franchised  restaurants.  For  purposes  of
clarity,  smallwares,  as generally  known, are reusable items with small dollar
values such as the ones  described  above which are used in the operation of the
business and (i) expensed under the Customer's current accounting practices when
they are for  replacements  and (ii)  capitalized  under the Customer's  current
accounting  practice when they are purchased as part of a new restaurant opening
or a major rollout of a new Restaurant Product. In contrast, equipment items are
always capitalized under the Customer's current accounting  practice (whether as
a new or replacement item) and food and suppliers are always expensed.

        (c) All  suppliers and  specifications  for all Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
KFC Restaurant  Products purchased by PFS must be approved in advance in writing
by Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFCC, respectively.  PFS hereby acknowledges that it
shall  have  no  role  in  the  process  of   approving   any  supplier  or  the
specifications for the Restaurant  Products.  PFS understands that Pizza Hut has
signed an  exclusive  agreement  with Leprino  Foods  Company to buy 100% of the
cheese  used on pizzas by the Pizza Hut  restaurants  within the  United  States
which are owned by Pizza Hut and its  subsidiaries.  As a result,  unless  other
suppliers  are  specifically  approved  in writing by Pizza Hut,  Leprino  Foods
Company will be the sole designated  supplier of such cheese  purchased by Pizza
Hut restaurants within the United States, both company owned and franchised.  As
described in Section 7 below,  the Customer's  Smart Sourcing  division or other
equivalent  purchasing function ("Smart Sourcing") shall negotiate the price and
other  purchase  terms of all  Restaurant  Products sold by PFS to the Exclusive
Restaurants  (defined below) and certain franchised Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC
restaurants  within the United  States.  PFS agrees  that it shall not  purchase
Restaurant  Products  under  agreements  negotiated  by Smart  Sourcing  for any
customers other than Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants  without the prior
written approval of Smart Sourcing.  Any breach of the preceding sentence by PFS
shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

        (d) As described in this Section 1, PFS is an approved  distributor  for
all Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC  restaurants  throughout  the  United  States,
Canada and the Export  Countries.  All  Sections  of this  Agreement  after this
Section 1 shall,  however,  only describe the relationship  between the Customer
and PFS with respect to certain Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants  within
the 48  contiguous  States of the  United  States of America  (the  "Continental
United States").  To the extent that PFS sells Restaurant Products to Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants  outside of the  Continental  United  States,  the
Customer and PFS shall separately  agree on the terms of their  relationship for
these restaurants.


2.      Appointment as Exclusive Distributor of Company Owned Restaurants.

        (a) The Customer hereby appoints PFS as the exclusive distributor during
the term of this  Agreement  of the  "Exclusive  Restaurant  Products"  (defined
below)   purchased  by  (i)  the  Pizza  Hut,  Taco  Bell  and  KFC  restaurants
(traditional  and  nontraditional  units) within the  Continental  United States
which are owned by the  Customer  on the  Closing  Date (as defined in Section 9
below) or any of its Subsidiaries  (defined below), except for Restaurants Under
Definitive Contract (defined below) and the 53 Excluded KFC Restaurants (defined
below)  or  (ii)  any  additional  Pizza  Hut,  Taco  Bell  or  KFC  restaurants
(traditional and nontraditional)  within the Continental United States which are
acquired or built by the  Customer or its  Subsidiaries  during the term of this
Agreement (the "Exclusive Restaurants").  The term "Restaurants Under Definitive
Contract"  shall mean any Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants  owned by the
Customer  which  the  Customer  has  agreed  to sell  pursuant  to a  definitive
agreement  signed by the parties  thereto  prior to the Closing  Date.  The term
"Excluded KFC Restaurants" shall mean the 53 KFC restaurants  currently owned by
WMCR  Corporation,  a subsidiary of KFCC, or hereafter built or acquired by WMCR
Corporation  in any of the four States  where it currently  operates,  Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. During the term of this Agreement, the Customer
and its  Subsidiaries  shall  purchase,  and PFS  agrees  to  sell,  100% of the
Exclusive  Restaurant  Products  required by the Exclusive  Restaurants,  except
incidental  purchases in emergency  situations.  The Customer agrees that during
the term of this Agreement no supplier or distributor  other than PFS shall sell
the  Exclusive  Restaurant  Products  to the  Exclusive  Restaurants;  provided,
however,  that if PFS for any reason fails to deliver any  Exclusive  Restaurant
Products on a scheduled delivery date which was ordered within the time required
for ordering as described in subsection  5(c) hereof,  the Exclusive  Restaurant
shall be permitted to purchase such Exclusive  Restaurant  Products from another
source or sources to meet its requirements  (but only for such order and not for
any future  orders),  and no such purchase shall be construed as a breach of the
Customer's  obligations  or require  additional  compensation  to PFS.  The term
Exclusive  Restaurants  shall  include all types of  nontraditional  restaurants
including  kiosks,  carts,  delivery units and  restaurants in hotels,  schools,
airports and hospitals but it shall not include any restaurants owned,  acquired
or built by the Customer which are not Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants.
To the extent the Customer owns,  acquires or builds other concept  restaurants,
they will only be considered  Exclusive  Restaurants under this Agreement if the
Customer  and PFS  specifically  agree in  writing  to  include  them under this
Agreement.

        (b) For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the term  "Exclusive  Restaurant
Products"  shall mean all  proprietary  and  non-proprietary  food (except fresh
chicken and fresh produce), restaurant supplies (including,  without limitation,
all paper  products) and smallwares  currently or in the future  approved by the
respective  Customer for purchase by any Exclusive  Restaurant.  Fresh  chicken,
fresh produce, equipment,  uniforms,  beverages,  promotional items and point of
purchase  materials  shall not be within the definition of Exclusive  Restaurant
Products.  As a result,  PFS shall be an approved  distributor  as  described in
Section 1 above  (but not an  exclusive  distributor)  of all such  nonexclusive
Restaurant   Products  which  are  excluded  from  the  definition  of  Excluded
Restaurant Products.  The above definition of Exclusive Restaurants Products may
be changed only by written agreement of the Customer and PFS.

        (c) For purposes of this Agreement,  the term "Subsidiaries"  shall mean
the  companies,  partnerships  or other  entities in which the Customer  owns at
least a majority of the total  equity  interests.  For  purposes of  convenience
only,  the  numerous   Subsidiaries  of  the  Customer  who  own  the  Exclusive
Restaurants are not signing this Agreement.  The Customer hereby unconditionally
guarantees the full  performance of the obligations of its  Subsidiaries who own
the Exclusive  Restaurants  during the term of this  Agreement and the fact that
such Subsidiaries are not signing this Agreement shall not affect in any way the
rights or obligations of the Customer or PFS under this Agreement.

        (d) A list of the  Exclusive  Restaurants  on the  Closing  Date will be
provided  by the  Customer to PFS on the  Closing  Date,  which list will be the
initial list of the Exclusive Restaurants.  If during the term of this Agreement
the Customer or any of its Subsidiaries  acquires or builds any additional Pizza
Hut,  Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants,  the Customer  shall so notify PFS and such
additional  restaurants shall be added to the list of Exclusive  Restaurants and
become subject to the terms of this  Agreement for the remaining  period of this
Agreement.  If the Customer or any of its  Subsidiaries  sell,  or enters into a
definitive  agreement to sell, any Pizza Hut or Taco Bell Exclusive  Restaurants
during the term of this Agreement,  and the buyer of such Exclusive  Restaurants
is or becomes a Pizza Hut or Taco Bell franchisee, as the case may be, the buyer
of such Exclusive Restaurants shall be required prior to such sale to enter into
a Sales and  Distribution  Agreement  with PFS with  respect  to such  purchased
Exclusive  Restaurants  on  substantially  the same terms and conditions as this
Agreement pursuant to which PFS will continue to be the exclusive distributor of
the  Exclusive   Restaurant   Products  for  such  newly  franchised   Exclusive
Restaurants  for a term  equal to the  remaining  term of this  Agreement.  As a
result,  PFS shall  continue to be the  exclusive  distributor  of the Exclusive
Restaurant  Products  during the remaining  period of the five year term of this
Agreement for any Exclusive  Restaurant sold by the Customer or its Subsidiaries
as a franchised Pizza Hut or Taco Bell  restaurant.  Once such buyer enters into
such a Sales and Distribution  Agreement with PFS with respect to such purchased
Exclusive Restaurants, the Customer shall have no further obligations under this
Agreement with respect to such purchased Exclusive  Restaurants and the Customer
shall not guarantee in any way the payment or other obligations of such buyer to
PFS. If the buyer of such  Exclusive  Restaurant  already owns other  franchised
Pizza Hut or Taco Bell  restaurants,  such other restaurants owned by such buyer
shall not be required to become  Exclusive  Restaurants  subject to the terms of
this  Agreement.  The  requirement  that  refranchised  Pizza  Hut and Taco Bell
Exclusive  Restaurants  must  continue to be  Exclusive  Restaurants  under this
Agreement shall not apply to KFC Exclusive  Restaurants  sold by the Customer or
its  Subsidiaries  during  the  term  of  this  Agreement.  If a  KFC  Exclusive
Restaurant is sold by the Customer or its  Subsidiaries  during the term of this
Agreement and becomes a franchised KFC  restaurant,  the terms of this Agreement
shall not apply to said KFC  restaurant  which will be removed  from the list of
Exclusive Restaurants.


3.      Prices For Exclusive Restaurant Products

        (a) The prices to be paid by the Exclusive Restaurants for the Exclusive
Restaurant  Products  purchased from PFS during the term of this Agreement shall
be equal to (x) the "Landed Cost"  (defined  below) of the Exclusive  Restaurant
Products plus an average mark up described in Exhibit B above as a percentage of
the Landed Cost of all Exclusive Restaurant Products plus (y) the costs of Smart
Sourcing  allocated to the Exclusive  Restaurant  Products and charged to PFS as
described  in Section 7 below.  As  described  in Exhibit B, the mark up will be
different for the different restaurant chains, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC.

        (b) The term "Landed  Cost" shall mean the F.O.B.  price to purchase the
Exclusive  Restaurant  Products from the vendor, net of all related  allowances,
discounts,  rebates, or other payments of any kind from the vendor to PFS or the
Customer (which will be fully passed  through),  plus the actual inbound freight
costs to ship the Exclusive  Restaurant Products to the distribution  centers of
PFS.  Landed Costs shall include the costs incurred by PFS in  transferring  the
Exclusive  Restaurant  Products  between  distribution  centers  only  if  these
transfers are for cross docking or break bulk purposes,  where the shipment from
the vendor to the final  distribution  center is  planned  to go  through  other
distribution  centers of PFS.  Any costs  incurred  by PFS in  transferring  the
Exclusive  Restaurant  Products between its distribution  centers as a result of
out of stocks (or equivalent  circumstances),  however,  shall not be considered
Landed Cost but instead  shall be borne by PFS. All cash or early pay  discounts
which are  received by PFS  (whether  negotiated  by Smart  Sourcing or PFS) for
paying the vendors of the Exclusive  Restaurant  Products before the payment due
date  negotiated by Smart Sourcing will not reduce or otherwise be factored into
the  calculation  of the Landed  Costs.  As  described  in Section 7 below,  the
inbound  freight  costs  to ship  the  Exclusive  Restaurant  Products  to PFS's
distribution  centers  will be  managed  by PFS unless  Smart  Sourcing  decides
otherwise  and all of PFS's  costs of such  inbound  freight  will be subject to
review by Smart Sourcing.

        (c) The  parties  will  agree on the  specific  method  of  billing  the
Exclusive Restaurants (e.g.,  electronic billing, faxed invoice or other format)
and whenever possible  electronic  billing will be used. The parties  understand
that at the time it sets its prices  lists PFS will only be able to  approximate
the  Landed  Costs  of the  Exclusive  Restaurant  Products  sold to each of the
respective  Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC Exclusive  Restaurants.  PFS agrees to
make a good faith  estimate of such  Landed  Costs at the time it sets its price
lists and to make appropriate  adjustments to subsequent invoices to make up for
any inaccuracies in the estimates.  In addition,  at the beginning of each month
during the term of this  Agreement  PFS and the Customer  shall  jointly  review
PFS's records relating to the Landed Costs of all Exclusive Restaurants Products
sold  to  each  of the  respective  Pizza  Hut,  Taco  Bell  and  KFC  Exclusive
Restaurants   during  the  prior  month  and  shall  agree  on  the  appropriate
adjustments to the subsequent  invoices to make up for any  inaccuracies  in the
estimates.  From time to time during the term of this  Agreement,  the  Customer
shall have the right to review all financial  and business  records of PFS which
are  reasonably  requested by the Customer to determine  the Landed Costs of the
Exclusive Restaurant Products sold to the Exclusive Restaurants.  Within 90 days
after  the end of each  calendar  year,  PFS shall  provide  to the  Customer  a
calculation by a major independent  international public accounting firm, agreed
upon by PFS and the Customer,  of the Landed Costs of all  Exclusive  Restaurant
Products sold to each of the  respective  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC Exclusive
Restaurants  during that  calendar  year (which  shall be during the stub period
from the Closing Date to December 31, 1997 for the 1997 calendar  year).  Within
30 days after receipt by the Customer of such  calculation  of the Landed Costs,
PFS or the Customer,  as the case may be, shall make an adjusting payment to the
other party to reflect the difference  between the amounts  actually  charged to
the Customer for the Exclusive  Restaurant Products and the amounts which should
have been charged based on such revised  calculation  of the Landed  Costs.  PFS
shall make available to the independent  accounting  firm all financial  records
necessary to make such calculation. The costs of the independent accounting firm
shall be shared equally by the Customer and PFS (50% by each).

        (d) The prices  described  in  paragraphs  (a),  (b) and (c) above shall
apply only to the Exclusive  Restaurant  Products.  For all Restaurant  Products
which are not included  within the definition of Exclusive  Restaurant  Products
(e.g., fresh chicken, fresh produce, equipment, uniforms, beverages, promotional
items and point of purchase materials),  the prices will be negotiated from time
to time by PFS and the Customer.

        (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the parties agree that the prices of
the Restaurant  Products which are food,  paper products and similar  restaurant
supplies  purchased by all Pizza Hut restaurants  within the Continental  United
States  (both  Pizza  Hut  Exclusive   Restaurants   and  Pizza  Hut  franchised
restaurants)  will continue  during the term of this  Agreement to be subject to
the 2.5% net pre-tax  profit  margin limit set forth in clause D (ii) of Section
8.3 of the standard Pizza Hut Franchise  Agreement,  a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit C. PFS agrees to  maintain  during the term of this  Agreement
the rebate  program for this 2.5% net pre-tax  profit margin limit for Pizza Hut
restaurants in the same manner as the program has been administered in the past,
including maintaining the current basis for allocating costs (including, without
limitation,  the current  method of charging a  hypothetical  interest cost) and
providing to Pizza Hut and its Pizza Hut  franchisees the audit of all allocated
costs and the rebate  payments  provided  for under  Section 8.3 of the standard
Pizza Hut Franchise Agreement.

4.      Payment Terms for the Restaurant Products

        (a) The Customer  shall pay to PFS the purchase price for the Restaurant
Products delivered to and accepted by the Customer within 30 calendar days after
the  date  of  invoice  (which  invoice  will  be the  same  day  as  delivery).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Exclusive Restaurant which is not owned by
the Customer  does not pay within the required  payment  terms,  such  Exclusive
Restaurant may be placed by PFS on a cash-on-delivery (C.O.D.) basis or required
to provide  security or collateral for amounts owed to PFS. Payment to PFS shall
be made (i) in the case of the Exclusive  Restaurants owned by the Customer,  by
wire transfer of funds and (ii) in the case of the Exclusive  Restaurants  which
are not owned by the Customer, upon receipt on the due date by PFS of a check in
PFS's lock box or by wire transfer of funds. No interest shall be charged to the
Customer  with  respect to  payments  made on or before the due date.  Early pay
discounts,  if any, will be negotiated by the Customer and PFS from time to time
during the term of this Agreement.

        (b) If any  amounts  due to PFS are  not  paid in  accordance  with  the
payment terms when due as described in subsection  4(a) above,  a service charge
shall be added to the sums due, which charge shall be equal to the lesser of (i)
an interest charge determined by applying to the delinquent  balance an interest
rate equal to the prime rate of interest of Citibank  N.A.  (as  published  from
time to time) plus 2% per annum or (ii) the amount  determined  by applying  the
maximum rate permitted to be charged under applicable state law.

        (c) If PFS decides to extend credit to any Exclusive Restaurant which is
not  owned by the  Customer,  such  credit  extension  shall be  subject  to the
condition that such franchised  Exclusive  Restaurants  provides (i) evidence of
continued  financial  ability  to pay its debts and (ii)  adequate  security  or
collateral as requested by PFS.


5.      Deliveries and Orders of the Restaurant Products excluding Equipment

        (a)  The  provisions  of this  Section  5  describe  the  mechanics  and
procedures  for  ordering  and   delivering  all  of  the  Restaurant   Products
distributed and sold by PFS to the Exclusive  Restaurants except for the new and
replacement   equipment  and  furnishings  which  PFS  sells  to  the  Exclusive
Restaurants through its equipment business and certain smallware items which are
not delivered through the PFS distribution centers (the "Non Fleet Smallwares").
The Restaurant  Products,  excluding equipment and furnishings and the Non Fleet
Smallwares,  is hereinafter referred to as the "F &amp; S Restaurant Products".  The
specific  mechanics  and  procedures  for ordering and  delivering of equipment,
furnishings and the Non Fleet  Smallwares is not described in this Agreement and
will be subject to the agreement of PFS and the Exclusive  Restaurants from time
to time.

        (b)  Deliveries of the F &amp; S Restaurant  Products  shall be made twice a
week to the Exclusive Restaurants. If the Customer desires to have more than two
deliveries per week for any particular Exclusive Restaurants,  the Customer will
be required to pay an additional charge to PFS in an amount to be negotiated and
agreed upon by PFS and the  Customer.  PFS will offer to the Customer a discount
off the purchase price of the F &amp; S Restaurant Products (in an amount determined
by PFS) if an Exclusive  Restaurant agrees to reduce the number of its scheduled
deliveries to less than two deliveries per week.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Exclusive  Restaurants  which  currently  receive three  deliveries per week
shall continue to receive three deliveries per week without  additional  charge.
PFS  may  deliver  the  ordered  F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products  to  the  Exclusive
Restaurant  at any  time  during  which  the  Exclusive  Restaurant  is open for
business  except  for the black out  periods  described  in  Exhibit D  attached
hereto,  or such other  black out  periods  which are agreed upon by PFS and the
Exclusive Restaurants.  Before the beginning of each such black out period PFS's
drivers must complete their  deliveries  and be out of the Exclusive  Restaurant
and failure to do so will not be considered as an on time  delivery.  PFS agrees
to start deliveries  within one hour (before or after) of the expected  delivery
time that PFS notifies an Exclusive Restaurant. As examples: (i) if the expected
delivery time is 9:00am and PFS's driver starts the delivery  between 8:00am and
10:00am,  the delivery will be on time but (ii) if the expected delivery time is
11:00am  for a Taco Bell  restaurant  and PFS's  driver  starts the  delivery at
11:00am but does not complete the delivery by 11:30am,  the delivery will not be
on time. PFS will notify the Exclusive Restaurants of the expected delivery time
no later than the day preceding the date of delivery.  If the delivery cannot be
started  within  such two hour  period  (one hour  before and one hour after the
scheduled  delivery time),  PFS will notify the Exclusive  Restaurant in advance
but the delivery will still be made the same day. PFS will be allowed to deliver
the F &amp; S Restaurant Products when the Exclusive Restaurant is closed (so called
"key"  deliveries)  only with the prior  written  approval  of an officer of the
Customer (or other  appropriate  level employee of the Exclusive  Restaurants as
designated by the Customer). If PFS's driver sets off an alarm at a key delivery
(other than because the Exclusive  Restaurant  did not provide the correct alarm
code) and there are charges incurred by the Exclusive  Restaurant as a result of
such alarm,  PFS will  reimburse  the  Exclusive  Restaurant  for such  charges.
Delivery days and times will be scheduled so as to cause as little  interruption
to  the  operation  of the  Exclusive  Restaurants  as is  practical  under  the
circumstances.

        (c) Orders by the  Customer for the F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products  must be
made to PFS no later  than  5:00pm  on the day  which  is two days  prior to the
scheduled delivery date; provided, however, that for Exclusive Restaurants which
are not close to a distribution center of PFS (not within one day normal driving
time from PFS's distribution  center), PFS may require that these orders be made
no later  than  5:00pm on the day  which is three  days  prior to the  scheduled
delivery  date. If there are any  exceptional  cases where PFS wishes to receive
orders four days prior to the scheduled  delivery date, they must be approved in
writing by the local manager of the affected Exclusive Restaurant. PFS agrees to
continue to maintain the "Sourcelink"  electronic ordering system (or equivalent
up to date  electronic  ordering  system) which  currently  allows the Exclusive
Restaurants to make electronic orders for the F &amp; S Restaurant Products.  If the
Sourcelink  orders are not  received  within two hours  before the 5:00pm  order
deadline, PFS will call the restaurant before the order deadline in order to try
to  receive  the order.  If the  distribution  center of PFS is still  unable to
receive  an  order  from an  Exclusive  Restaurant  prior  to the  5:00pm  order
deadline,  PFS shall automatically order for the Exclusive  Restaurant the exact
same  order  it  received  for the  same  day of the  previous  week  (excluding
smallwares)  and the  Exclusive  Restaurant  will be  required  to  accept  such
delivery when made.  To the extent the Exclusive  Restaurant is late in ordering
or changes its order after the 5:00pm  order  deadline,  PFS is not  required to
accept such late or changed order. If PFS decides to accept such late or changed
order, PFS may charge the Customer a special delivery charge to be negotiated by
PFS and the Customer.

        (d)  Deliveries  shall be to such location on the  Exclusive  Restaurant
premises as the Exclusive  Restaurants shall reasonably direct. F &amp; S Restaurant
Products shall be deemed  delivered when actually placed in the storage areas of
the Exclusive Restaurant (including the temperature  controlled  compartments in
the case of the  frozen or  refrigerated  F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products)  by PFS's
drivers, as reasonably directed by employees of the Exclusive Restaurant.  PFS's
drivers  will not be  required to stock  shelves or rotate the F &amp; S  Restaurant
Products.  The Exclusive  Restaurants  will be responsible to keep the back door
and aisle free of debris  for PFS's  drivers  to  deliver  the F &amp; S  Restaurant
Products to the storage  areas.  To the extent  practicable,  deliveries  by PFS
shall have unloading priority over all other vendors. The Exclusive  Restaurants
shall assign and make  available  an employee or  employees to accept  delivery,
subject to the terms of paragraph (f) below, of F &amp; S Restaurant  Products,  and
to sign the invoice documenting receipt of the ordered F &amp; S Restaurant Products
(to the extent received and not damaged).

        (e) PFS will only deliver the F &amp; S Restaurant Products specified by the
Customer and shall not  substitute  products for the F &amp; S Restaurant  Products;
provided,  however, that the delivery on an infrequent basis of F &amp; S Restaurant
Products in a different  size than ordered  shall not be considered a substitute
if the total  quantity of the F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products is the amount  ordered
(e.g.,  delivery of two 12 ounce jars instead of four 6 ounce jars).  PFS agrees
to comply with all quality  assurance  programs and  guidelines  required by the
Customer from time to time during the term of this  Agreement to ensure that the
quality of the F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products is  maintained  while the  Restaurant
Product is being stored,  handled and  transported  by PFS. The current  quality
assurance  programs and  guidelines of each of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC have
been provided to PFS prior to the date hereof.

        (f) If ordered F &amp; S Restaurant Products are not delivered by PFS on the
scheduled delivery date (including key deliveries),  or are delivered damaged or
not  meeting  the  required  specification,  at the  request  of  the  Exclusive
Restaurant,  PFS will make a special  delivery to redeliver the F &amp; S Restaurant
Products  as quickly as  possible.  In  addition,  PFS shall take back all F &amp; S
Restaurant  Products which are damaged or out of specification and give a credit
to the  Exclusive  Restaurant  for  the  purchase  price  charged  by PFS to the
Exclusive Restaurant for that product. If the F &amp; S Restaurant Products were out
of  specification  or the  damages  were  internal  and not  visible to PFS upon
receiving delivery of the F &amp; S Restaurant  Products from the vendor, the vendor
shall be  responsible  to PFS for all  costs  relating  to making  such  special
deliveries  and to take back  damaged or out of  specification  F &amp; S Restaurant
Products.  The Customer and PFS each agree to use their  respective best efforts
to collect such costs from the vendors.

        (g) If the Customer decides to return any nonperishable F &amp; S Restaurant
Products ordered by the Customer and delivered to it within  specification,  not
damaged and on the scheduled  delivery  date,  PFS shall charge the Customer for
taking back such F &amp; S Restaurant  Product an amount equal to 15% of the invoice
price of such F &amp; S Restaurant Product (as a restocking fee).

        (h) Title and risk of loss for the F &amp; S Restaurant  Products  purchased
by the Exclusive  Restaurants  from PFS shall pass to the Exclusive  Restaurants
upon delivery by PFS inside the Exclusive Restaurant.  In the event that any F &amp;
S Restaurant Products are delivered and subsequently  returned or rejected by an
Exclusive  Restaurant,  title  and  risk of loss  shall  revert  to PFS upon the
physical transfer of possession of the F &amp; S Restaurant Products back to PFS.

        (i) The Customer acknowledges and agrees that PFS has full discretion to
direct all deliveries from any  distribution  center which PFS operates,  and to
make  such  changes  to the  routing  process  as PFS,  in its sole  discretion,
determines  appropriate;  provided,  however, that PFS shall notify the affected
Pizza  Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC  restaurants  of any  changes in its  routes.  In
addition,  the  Customer  acknowledges  and agrees  that PFS's  fleet may not be
solely dedicated to the distribution of F &amp; S Restaurant  Products to Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell and KFC restaurants. As a result, PFS's fleet which distribute the F &amp;
S Restaurant Products to Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants may also carry
other products for delivery to other customers  (including  competing customers)
on the same  routes  so long as they do not in any way  damage,  contaminate  or
adversely  affect  the  quality  of the F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products  during  the
delivery or adversely affect deliveries to the Exclusive Restaurants.

        (j) Management of the inventory  levels in the  distribution  centers of
PFS will be the  responsibility  of PFS except  that PFS agrees that it will not
buy any F &amp; S Restaurant  Products  which PFS expects to keep in  inventory  for
more than 60 days without the consent of the Customer.  PFS agrees to provide to
the extent practicable weekly information to the Customer by distribution center
of its  inventory  levels  of the F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products.  PFS shall not be
required  to buy  promotional  items  or new or  test  market  F &amp; S  Restaurant
Products until it first receives a firm commitment from the Customer and, in the
case of such promotional  items or new or test market F &amp; S Restaurant  Products
which are for sale to franchised Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC restaurants,  until
it first  receives a firm  commitment  from such  franchisees  to purchase  such
promotional  items  or new or test  market  F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products.  If any
promotional items or any other F &amp; S Restaurant Products which are unique to the
Customer's  operations are purchased by PFS based on the Customer's  projections
and such F &amp; S Restaurant  Products  remain in PFS's  inventory for more than 90
days after  Customer's  projected need,  however,  PFS may charge the Customer a
storage  and  handling  charge  equal  to 1 % of the  Landed  Cost of such F &amp; S
Restaurant Products per month until such F &amp; S Restaurant Products are delivered
to the Customer.  Each month during the term of this  Agreement the Customer and
PFS shall meet to review the amount of  promotional  items or other unique F &amp; S
Restaurant Products which have remained in inventory for more than 90 days after
Customer's  projected need and use their  respective  best efforts to agree on a
schedule for delivery of such excess  inventory to the Exclusive  Restaurants as
quickly as possible and in any event not more than an  additional  90 days after
such initial 90 day period. At the end of such additional 90 day period, PFS may
require the  Customer to either  order such  excess  inventory  or direct PFS to
dispose of such excess inventory at the Customer's cost.  Unless either (i) an F
&amp; S  Restaurant  Product is  discontinued  by the  Customer or (ii) the Customer
approves an AIP  (authorization  for  inventory  purchase)  for F &amp; S Restaurant
Products  ordered by  franchised  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants,  the
Customer  shall not be  responsible  to PFS for any storage  charges or purchase
commitments of any franchised Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC restaurants.

        (k) In the event the Customer decides to recall any Restaurant  Product,
PFS agrees to assist the  Customer,  to the extent  reasonably  requested by the
Customer,  in  its  recall  efforts,  including,  without  limitation,  promptly
assisting the Customer in determining  exactly which Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC
restaurants may need to be notified of a product recall.  Unless such recall was
needed as a result of any action or omission to act by PFS, the Customer (or the
vendor at the Customer's direction) shall reimburse PFS for all additional costs
incurred by PFS (e.g.,  labor, fuel, etc.) in such recall efforts, to the extent
such recall was requested by the Customer.

        (l) PFS warrants that all F &amp; S Restaurant Products to be distributed by
it to Pizza  Hut,  Taco Bell or KFC  restaurants  shall be  inspected,  handled,
stored,  shipped and sold by PFS in strict  compliance  with all  applicable (i)
federal and state laws (ii) rules and regulations of all  governmental  agencies
having  jurisdiction  and (iii)  municipal  ordinances.  Upon its receipt of any
citation issued by any  governmental or regulatory  authority which might result
in the interruption in PFS's distribution service to any Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or
KFC restaurant  customers,  PFS shall promptly  notify such customers who may be
affected.

        (m) PFS agrees to use its best  efforts to take and respond to emergency
calls from the Exclusive  Restaurants for delivery of F &amp; S Restaurant Products.
PFS and the Exclusive  Restaurants will agree upon the additional  charges to be
paid to PFS for special deliveries needed to respond to such emergency calls.

6.      Minimum Service Levels.

        (a) PFS agrees to maintain during the term of this Agreement, on a total
basis for all  Exclusive  Restaurants  serviced  by PFS,  each of the  following
monthly service levels:

               (i) The actual number of Perfect Orders  (defined below) of the F
        &amp; S Restaurant Products which are delivered to the Exclusive Restaurants
        during each month as a percentage  of the total number of  deliveries of
        the F &amp; S Restaurant Products ordered shall not be less than 85%; and

               (ii) The number of  deliveries  of the F &amp; S Restaurant  Products
        during any month which are on time  (within one hour before or after the
        scheduled delivery time as described in Section 5(b) above) shall not be
        less than 80%.

        The above  service  levels  shall be  measured  on a total basis for all
distribution  centers  of PFS  together  (not  separately  for  each  individual
distribution  center).  Key deliveries  will not be factored in any way into the
measurement of on time deliveries described in (ii) above.

        If PFS fails to achieve  either of such service  levels during any three
months of any calendar  year during the term of this  Agreement  (commencing  in
1998),  this  failure  shall  constitute  a  material  breach of this  Agreement
entitling  the  Customer  to  terminate  this  Agreement  upon  notice to PFS as
described in Section 10 below.

        (b) PFS agrees to maintain  during the term of this  Agreement,  for the
Exclusive Restaurants serviced by each distribution center of PFS, the following
monthly service level:

               The  actual  number of  Perfect  Orders  of the F &amp; S  Restaurant
               Products  which are delivered to the Exclusive  Restaurants  from
               that distribution center during each month as a percentage of the
               total  number  of  deliveries  of the F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products
               ordered shall not be less than 75%.

        The  above  service  level  shall  be  measured   separately   for  each
distribution center of PFS which delivers to the Exclusive Restaurants.

        If PFS fails to achieve the above  service level during any three months
of any calendar year during the term of this Agreement (commencing in 1998), the
Customer  shall  have the  right  upon  notice to PFS to  remove  the  Exclusive
Restaurants  which were  serviced by such  distribution  center from the list of
Exclusive Restaurants.  As a result, if the Customer gives such notice, PFS will
lose  the  exclusive  right  under  this  Agreement  to  deliver  the  Exclusive
Restaurant  Products to the Exclusive  Restaurants  which were customers of such
underperforming distribution center.

        (c) The term  "Perfect  Order"  shall mean a delivery  where 100% of the
cases of the  delivered  F &amp; S  Restaurant  Products  are (i)  exactly the items
ordered  by  the  Exclusive  Restaurant,  (ii)  not  damaged  and  (iii)  within
specification.

        If PFS does not deliver a F &amp; S  Restaurant  Product  because the vendor
was not able to supply a F &amp; S Restaurant  Product  ordered by PFS, such failure
shall not be counted against the service levels  described in paragraphs (a) and
(b) above.

        Promptly  after the end of each month PFS shall  notify the  Customer of
its service levels described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above for that month and,
at the request of the Customer,  PFS shall make available to the Customer all of
its records which support its determination of the service levels and such other
records reasonably requested by the Customer.


7.      Smart Sourcing.

        (a) PFS and Smart Sourcing intend that their  relationship will be based
on a spirit of cooperation where they will support each other whenever possible.
During  the term of this  Agreement,  Smart  Sourcing  will  negotiate  with the
vendors all price and other purchase terms for all Restaurant Products which are
distributed  and sold by PFS to any Exclusive  Restaurants  and such prices will
constitute,  together  with inbound  freight,  the Landed Costs of the Exclusive
Restaurant  Products as described in Section 3 above.  The  commitment by PFS to
exclusively  buy under terms and  agreements  negotiated  by Smart  Sourcing all
Restaurant  Products  sold  to  the  Exclusive  Restaurants  is  subject  to the
exception that if PFS is able to buy such Restaurant  Products for the Exclusive
Restaurants  on terms more  favorable to the  Exclusive  Restaurants  than those
negotiated by Smart Sourcing,  PFS will notify the Customer of such better terms
and offer the Customer the opportunity to buy such  Restaurant  Products on such
better terms  negotiated by PFS. For the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC  franchised
restaurants  which are customers of PFS,  other than the  Exclusive  Restaurants
which are franchised,  PFS shall be required to purchase the Restaurant Products
sold to such franchised Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants  under the terms and
agreements which are negotiated by Smart Sourcing for the Exclusive  Restaurants
owned by the Customer but PFS may, but it shall not be required to, purchase the
Restaurant  Products sold to such  franchised KFC  restaurants  under prices and
other terms which are negotiated by Smart  Sourcing.  As a result,  PFS shall be
committed to exclusively  buy through Smart Sourcing terms and agreements all of
the  Restaurant  Products  it  sells  to  franchised  Pizza  Hut and  Taco  Bell
restaurants  but PFS shall not be committed  to  exclusively  buy through  Smart
Sourcing  terms all of the  Restaurant  Products it sells to the  franchised KFC
restaurants which are not Exclusive  Restaurants.  Smart Sourcing shall have the
right  to  allocate  among  two or  more  vendors  the  total  purchases  of the
Restaurant  Products  purchased  under terms and agreements  negotiated by Smart
Sourcing.  In addition,  Smart Sourcing shall have the right to determine  which
vendors will supply the Restaurant Products purchased under terms and agreements
negotiated by Smart Sourcing to each of the respective  distribution  centers of
PFS. The Customer  agrees that the  "Weighted  Average  Payment  Term"  (defined
below) for the Restaurant  Products purchased during any calendar quarter by PFS
and negotiated through Smart Sourcing will be no less than 15 calendar days. For
purposes of this Agreement,  the term "Weighted Average Payment Term" shall mean
the average  number of days after invoice which the suppliers of the  Restaurant
Products  purchased  through Smart Sourcing require for payment by PFS, weighted
by the Dollar volumes for the different items of the Restaurant Products and the
different  required  terms for payment.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Smart
Sourcing may negotiate  payment terms for Restaurant  Products  purchased by PFS
for sale to the  Exclusive  Restaurants  owned by the Customer  (not  franchised
Exclusive  Restaurants) which result in a Weighted Average Payment Term for such
Restaurant  Products  below 15 calendar  days so long as there is an  equivalent
reduction in the  receivable  payment terms for such  Exclusive  Restaurants  to
fully  compensate PFS for paying earlier than a Weighted Average Payment Term of
15 days.  As described  in Section 3(b) above,  PFS shall be entitled to receive
all early pay  discounts and such  discounts  shall not reduce the amount of the
Landed  Costs.  Smart  Sourcing  shall  have the  right to  negotiate  early pay
discounts  which PFS will receive so long as the Weighted  Average Payment Term,
after taking into account such  discounts,  is not less than 15 calendar days as
described above.  Smart Sourcing agrees that PFS shall have the right to receive
a total amount of early pay  discounts  equal to at least  $10,600,000  per year
(commencing in 1998), without any reduction in the Weighted Average Payment Term
below 15 days.  If PFS does not have the right to receive  at least  $10,600,000
early pay discounts  during any calendar year during the term of this  Agreement
(commencing in 1998) without reducing the Weighted Average Payment Term below 15
days,  Smart Sourcing  shall pay to PFS the amount of such  shortfall  within 30
days after the end of such  calendar  year.  In  addition,  Smart  Sourcing  may
negotiate  payment terms which  include an interest  charge for late payments by
PFS to the  supplier  equal to the lesser of: (i) the prime rate of  interest of
Citibank  N.A.  (as  published  from time to time) plus 2% per annum or (ii) the
maximum rate permitted to be charged under applicable State law.

        (b) Except as described  below,  all inbound  freight of the  Restaurant
Products to the  distribution  centers of PFS,  including  the  selection of the
carriers  and the  negotiation  of the freight  charges,  will be managed by and
incurred  by PFS as  part  of its  distribution  services  provided  under  this
Agreement  (without any additional  fee to the Customer).  PFS agrees to use its
best efforts to reduce its inbound freight costs and whenever  possible  arrange
for deliveries of the Restaurant Products in full truckloads.  If Smart Sourcing
requests,  PFS shall be  required  to obtain  Smart  Sourcing's  approval of all
deliveries which are less than full truckloads;  provided,  however,  that Smart
Sourcing will bear all  additional  costs to comply with this approval  process.
PFS shall make  available to Smart  Sourcing,  at such intervals as requested by
Smart Sourcing,  all of the records of PFS relating to its inbound freight costs
for the Restaurant Products. Smart Sourcing shall have the right at any time and
in its  discretion to require PFS to receive prior  approval from Smart Sourcing
for all inbound  freight  charges before they are incurred;  provided,  however,
that Smart Sourcing will bear all additional  costs to comply with this approval
process.  In addition,  Smart Sourcing shall also have the right at any time and
in its discretion to take over the inbound freight function from PFS,  including
the selection of carriers and negotiation of rates.

        (c) In addition to and separate from PFS's  appointment as the exclusive
distributor of the Exclusive Restaurant Products to the Exclusive Restaurants as
described in Section 2 hereof, the Customer agrees that, during the term of this
Agreement,  Smart Sourcing will not allow another  distributor other than PFS to
distribute the Restaurant Products to any Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC franchised
restaurant  within  the  Continental  United  States  under the prices and other
purchase terms negotiated by Smart Sourcing.  In other words, in addition to the
Exclusive  Restaurants,  PFS will also be the exclusive  distributor  during the
term of this Agreement for franchised  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC  restaurants
which  purchase  the   Restaurant   Products   through  Smart  Sourcing   terms.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if KFC National  Purchasing  Cooperative,  Inc.
purchases,  or arranges for the purchase of, Restaurant  Products for franchised
KFC  restaurants  under  prices and other  purchase  terms  negotiated  by Smart
Sourcing,  the  provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not apply with respect to
the  Restaurant  Products so purchased and the  distributor  of such  Restaurant
Products may be a firm other than PFS.

        (d) The Customer  shall charge PFS a fee for  providing  the services of
its Smart Sourcing division equal to 1/2 % of the F.O.B. price of the vendors of
the  Restaurant  Products  which are purchased by PFS under terms and agreements
negotiated by Smart Sourcing.  PFS shall pass on this fee to its Pizza Hut, Taco
Bell and KFC customers  (including the Exclusive  Restaurants and all franchised
restaurants)  within the Continental United States, as described in Section 3(a)
in the case of Exclusive Restaurant Products sold to the Exclusive  Restaurants.
The  proportion  of the total Smart  Sourcing  costs which are  allocated to the
Restaurant  Products  sold  to  the  Exclusive  Restaurants  cannot  exceed  the
percentage of the total purchases by PFS of all Restaurant  Products under terms
and  agreements  negotiated by Smart  Sourcing which is represented by the total
purchases by PFS of the Restaurant  Products sold to the Exclusive  Restaurants.
Promptly  after the end of each  month  during  the term of this  Agreement  the
Customer  shall send to PFS an invoice for its Smart Sourcing fee for that month
which invoice will be due within 15 days after receipt. PFS shall have the right
to require Smart Sourcing to provide evidence reasonably acceptable to PFS which
supports Smart Sourcing's calculation of its fee.


8.      Continuation of Equipment Business

        Although  the  equipment  products of PFS are not part of the  Exclusive
Restaurant  Products sold to the Exclusive  Restaurants,  PFS currently plans to
maintain the equipment business and to make the equipment products available for
purchase by the Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC  restaurant  customers of PFS. PFS
agrees to provide to the  Customer  and its other  Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC
franchised  restaurant  customers at least six months prior notice before either

authority to assume, create or expand any obligation or responsibility,  express
or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other party, or to bind the other
party in any manner or matter whatsoever.  Neither party to this Agreement shall
have any authority to employ any person as agent or employee for or on behalf of
the other party to this Agreement for any purpose.  It is the express  intention
of the parties  that each party hold the other party  harmless  from and against
any and all claims, liability and expense arising out of any unauthorized act of
its respective employees and agents.


16.     General Provisions

        (a)  Appointment of Executive  Officers of Customer.  During the term of
this Agreement  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFCC shall notify PFS in writing of the
names of the  executive  officers who shall have the authority to bind all three
companies,  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFCC and act on behalf of the Customer,  in
connection  with any  matter  relating  to this  Agreement,  including,  without
limitation,  amending the terms of this  Agreement as described in Section 16(e)
below.

        (b) Dispute  Resolution.  Each of the Customer and PFS shall appoint one
or more employees who will meet with each other on a regular basis to review the
performance by each party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The Customer
and PFS shall each  appoint  an  executive  officer  to meet for the  purpose of
resolving any claim,  dispute and/or  controversy  arising out of or relating to
the performance of this Agreement. If the dispute is not resolved by negotiation
within  thirty (30) days,  the parties  shall  endeavor to settle the dispute by
mediation  under the then  current  Center For Public  Resources  ("CPR")  Model
Procedure  for Mediation of Business  Disputes.  The neutral third party will be
selected from the CPR panel of neutrals,  with the assistance of CPR, unless the
parties  agree  otherwise.  In the event that the  parties are  unsuccessful  in
resolving the dispute via  mediation,  the parties agree promptly to resolve any
such claim, dispute and/or controversy through binding confidential  arbitration
conducted in Louisville,  Kentucky, in accordance with the then current rules of
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The parties irrevocably consent to
such  jurisdiction for purposes of the arbitration,  and judgment may be entered
thereon in any state or federal  court in the same manner as if the parties were
residents of the state of federal  district in which said  judgment is sought to
be entered.  The  arbitrator  shall not make any award or  decision  that is not
consistent  with  applicable  law.  In  any  action  between  the  parties,  the
prevailing party in such action shall recover its costs and expenses,  including
reasonable attorney fees, from the non-prevailing party. All applicable statutes
of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled while
the requirements of this Section 16(b) are being followed.

        (c) Access to  Distribution  Centers.  During the term of this Agreement
the Customer shall have the right to inspect at any time during the term of this
Agreement the distribution  centers,  all delivery trucks and any other facility
of PFS which carry the Restaurant Products.

        (d) Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon all of the parties
hereto and upon all of their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.
The Customer  understands  that PFS is currently in the process of being sold by
PepsiCo,  Inc.  PFS shall have the right to assign  its  rights and  obligations
under this Agreement to any corporation, partnership, firm or other entity which
buys  substantially  all of PFS's assets and upon such assignment (i) such buyer
shall assume all of PFS's obligations under this Agreement and take the place of
PFS for all purposes of this  Agreement  and (ii)  PepsiCo,  Inc.  shall have no
further  obligations  hereunder.  Except for the permitted  assignment by PFS as
described  above,   this  Agreement  shall  not,   however,   be  assignable  or
transferable,  in whole or in part,  by any party except upon the express  prior
written consent of all of the other parties.  Any attempt to assign or otherwise
transfer this Agreement or any rights or  obligations  hereunder in violation of
the foregoing shall be void.

        (e)  Amendments.  This Agreement  shall not be amended except in writing
signed by all parties hereto.

notice, demand, consent or communication given hereunder in the manner described
above  shall be deemed to have been  effected  and  received as of the date hand
delivered or as of the date received if sent by overnight air courier.

        (g) Force Majeure.  No party shall be responsible for delays or defaults
under this  Agreement if such delay or default is  occasioned  by war,  strikes,
fire, an act of God or other causes beyond such party's control.

        (h) Waiver. No provision,  requirement,  or breach of this Agreement may
be waived by any party  except in  writing.  If any party  fails to enforce  any
right or remedy  available  under  this  Agreement,  that  failure  shall not be
construed as a waiver of any right or remedy with respect to any other breach or
failure  by the other  parties.  If PFS fails to  maintain  the  service  levels
described  in Sections 6 hereof  during any three  months of any  calendar  year
during the term of this Agreement (commencing in 1998) and the Customer does not
exercise its right to  terminate  this  Agreement as described in Section  10(b)
hereof within 90 days after the third such month,  the Customer  shall waive any
right to terminate  this Agreement with respect to the low service levels during

construed in accordance with and governed by the  substantive  laws of the State
of Kentucky without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.

        (k) Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid,  illegal, or unenforceable
in any respect,  such  invalidity,  illegality,  or  unenforceability  shall not
affect any other provision  hereof,  and this Agreement shall be construed as if
such invalid,  illegal,  or  unenforceable  provision  had never been  contained
herein.

        (l)  Other  Documents.  The  terms,  conditions  and  provisions  of any
invoice, billing statement,  confirmation, or other similar document relating to
the services  rendered in connection  with this  Agreement  shall be subject and
subordinate  to the terms,  provisions  and conditions of this Agreement and, in
the event of a conflict between the terms, conditions and provisions of any such
document and of this  Agreement,  the terms,  conditions  and provisions of this
Agreement shall govern.

        (m) Survival of  Obligations.  The  obligations  of any party under this
Agreement, which by their nature would continue beyond expiration or termination
of this Agreement,
